# Billing & Finance — Partners in Biz Platform API

Full invoicing + payments + recurring billing + expenses + financial reports. Designed for South African operations: **EFT is primary (zero fees), PayPal is secondary (international clients). No Stripe.**

## Base URL & Authentication

```
https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1
```

```
Authorization: Bearer <AI_API_KEY>
```

Two public endpoints:
- `POST /invoices/[id]/mark-viewed?token=X` — invoice view tracking
- `POST /webhooks/paypal` — PayPal webhook receiver

## Payment philosophy

1. **EFT is preferred.** Banking details live on the platform owner org's `billingDetails.bankingDetails`. When an invoice is sent, the client receives a public link showing the banking details + a reference (invoice number). They pay via EFT, then upload proof of payment. Admin (or agent) verifies the proof and confirms → invoice moves to `paid`.

2. **PayPal is secondary.** Only active if `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` + `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` env vars are set. Used for international clients where EFT isn't practical. Flow: create PayPal order → client approves → capture → invoice paid.

3. **No Stripe** — deliberately not supported.

Required env vars for PayPal: `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `PAYPAL_ENV` (`live` or `sandbox`), `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`, `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.

## PiB-owned billing model

PiB-issued invoices and quotes are source/recipient records:

- `orgId`, `sourceOrgId`, and `issuerOrgId` are the sender/source workspace. For Partners in Biz billing, this is the resolved platform owner org (`type === 'platform_owner'`, normally `pib-platform-owner`).
- `billingOrgId` identifies the billing entity and is normally the same platform owner org for PiB-issued billing.
- `recipientOrgId` and `targetOrgId` are the client organization that receives the invoice or quote.
- `companyId` / `sourceCompanyId` point to the sender-owned CRM Company, normally the PiB platform CRM Company whose `linkedOrgId` is the client org.
- `contactId` / `sourceContactId` point to the sender-owned CRM Contact when the invoice or quote targets a specific contact.

Do not treat `allowedOrgIds` as client portal/CRM access. It scopes admin billing visibility only. Client users and explicit client members see received billing through `view=received`.

## Invoice status machine

```
draft ──► sent ──► viewed ──► payment_pending_verification ──► paid
              │                                        │
              └──► paid (PayPal immediate capture)     └──► sent (if rejected)
              │
              └──► overdue (cron flips after dueDate)
              │
              └──► cancelled
```

Any status → `cancelled`. `partially_paid` exists as a state but is rarely used.

## Collaboration primitives

- **Idempotency** on `POST /invoices`, `POST /quotes` (see `crm-sales`), and `POST /expenses`
- **Comments** (`resourceType: 'invoice' | 'expense'`): internal notes with `@mentions`
- **Notifications**: auto-created on `invoice.paid`, `invoice.overdue`, `expense.submitted`, proof uploads

## API Reference

### Invoices — CRUD

#### `GET /invoices` — auth: admin
List invoices. Supports source/recipient views.

- Default/sent view: `?orgId=X` filters by sender/source org.
- Received view: `?view=received&orgId=<clientOrgId>` filters by `recipientOrgId`.
- Platform billing view: `?view=received&billingOrgId=pib-platform-owner` lists PiB-issued invoices by recipient client. Super admins see all; restricted admins see only invoices whose `recipientOrgId` is in explicit `allowedOrgIds`.
- Shared view: `?view=shared` returns token/claim-backed rows without leaking unrelated org data.

Sorted `createdAt desc`, limit 50.

#### `POST /invoices` — auth: admin
Required: `orgId` (client org), `lineItems: [{ description, quantity, unitPrice }]`.

Body:
```json
{
  "orgId": "org_client",
  "recipientOrgId": "org_client",
  "companyId": "crm_company_id",
  "contactId": "crm_contact_id",
  "lineItems": [
    { "description": "Strategy session", "quantity": 2, "unitPrice": 2500 },
    { "description": "Implementation", "quantity": 1, "unitPrice": 15000 }
  ],
  "dueDate": "2026-05-01",
  "taxRate": 15,
  "currency": "ZAR",
  "notes": "Payment via EFT preferred — banking details on public invoice page."
}
```

For admin/AI PiB-issued invoices without CRM claim fields, `orgId` is the client/recipient org in the request; the API resolves the platform owner as `sourceOrgId` and writes `recipientOrgId=orgId`. For CRM-targeted invoices, pass `companyId`/`contactId` and optional `recipientOrgId`; if the Company already has `linkedOrgId`, the API reuses it.

Auto-snapshots:
- `fromDetails` from platform owner org (name, address, email, phone, vatNumber, bankingDetails)
- `clientDetails` from client org (`billingDetails`, `billingEmail`)
- Sequential `invoiceNumber` like `CLI-001` via `generateInvoiceNumber`
- `billingOrgId` — identifies the platform org issuing the invoice. Defaults to the `platform_owner` org. Override via `body.billingOrgId` when a workspace runs multiple billing entities. Reports use this to separate revenue per billing entity.
- `recipientOrgId` / `targetOrgId` — client org when known.
- `claimStatus` / `claimToken` — present when invoice is claimable from a CRM recipient.

Auto-computes: `subtotal`, `taxAmount`, `total`. Defaults currency from client org `settings.currency` or `USD`.

Response (201): `{ id, invoiceNumber }`. Dispatches `invoice.created`.

#### `GET /invoices/[id]` — auth: admin
Full invoice.

#### `PATCH /invoices/[id]` — auth: admin
Update fields. Recomputes totals if `lineItems` or `taxRate` changes.

#### `DELETE /invoices/[id]` — auth: admin
Soft-cancel (`status: 'cancelled'`).

#### `POST /invoices/preview` — auth: admin
Body: invoice-like JSON. Optional `orgId` enriches the preview with real client billing details and platform-owner sender details after access validation. Returns rendered invoice HTML and does not create a Firestore invoice. Useful before committing.

#### `GET /invoices/next-number?orgId=X` — auth: admin
Returns the next invoice number for the client org: `{ invoiceNumber: "CLI-042" }`.

#### `GET /invoices/[id]/pdf` — auth: admin
Returns a PDF binary (Content-Type: application/pdf).

#### `POST /invoices/[id]/duplicate` — auth: admin
Clones the invoice as a new `draft`. Returns `{ id, invoiceNumber }`.

#### `POST /invoices/[id]/recurring` — auth: admin
Creates an active recurring schedule for this invoice. Body requires `interval` (`daily|weekly|monthly|quarterly|yearly`) and `startDate`; optional `endDate`. Fails with 409 if an active/paused schedule already exists.

#### `DELETE /invoices/[id]/recurring` — auth: admin
Cancels the active/paused recurring schedule for this invoice by setting `status: cancelled`.

### Invoice actions — send + status

#### `POST /invoices/[id]/send` — auth: admin
Generates `publicToken` if absent, sets `status: 'sent'`, `sentAt`. Emails `clientDetails.email` with the public view URL + PDF link.

Dispatches `invoice.sent` webhook.

#### `POST /invoices/[id]/mark-viewed?token=X` — **public**
Called by the public invoice view page when loaded. Sets `firstViewedAt` (once), increments `viewCount`, auto-flips `status: 'sent' → 'viewed'`. 404 if token doesn't match.

### Invoice actions — payment

#### `GET /invoices/[id]/payment-instructions` — auth: admin OR `?token=<publicToken>`
Dual-auth. Either pass the admin `Authorization` header, or pass the invoice's `publicToken` as `?token=X`. The public invoice view page uses the token path.

Returns:
```json
{
  "invoiceNumber": "CLI-042",
  "total": 17250,
  "currency": "ZAR",
  "dueDate": "2026-05-01",
  "eft": {
    "bankingDetails": {
      "bankName": "FNB",
      "accountName": "Partners in Biz (Pty) Ltd",
      "accountNumber": "...",
      "branchCode": "...",
      "swift": "..."
    },
    "reference": "CLI-042",
    "proofOfPaymentEmail": "billing@partnersinbiz.online"
  },
  "paypal": { "available": true, "url": "<BASE>/api/v1/invoices/inv_xyz/paypal-order" },
  "publicViewUrl": "https://partnersinbiz.online/invoice/<publicToken>"
}
```

Generates `publicToken` if missing. `paypal.available: true` only if `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` set.

#### `POST /invoices/[id]/payment-proof` — auth: admin (or client portal)
Client uploaded proof of payment. Body: `{ fileId: string, note?: string }`.

Updates: `status: 'payment_pending_verification'`, `paymentProofFileId`, `paymentProofUploadedAt`. Creates org-wide notification for platform admins.

#### `POST /invoices/[id]/confirm-payment` — auth: admin
Admin verifies the uploaded proof.

Body to confirm:
```json
{ "confirmed": true, "paymentMethod": "eft", "reference": "...", "amount": 17250 }
```

Body to reject:
```json
{ "confirmed": false, "reason": "Amount doesn't match invoice total" }
```

- Confirmed: `status: 'paid'`, `paidAt`, `paymentMethod`, `paymentReference`, `paidAmount`. Dispatches `invoice.paid` + `payment.received`. Notifies invoice creator.
- Rejected: `status: 'sent'` (reverts), `paymentProofRejectedReason`, `paymentProofRejectedAt`. Notifies proof uploader.

#### `PATCH /invoices/[id]/mark-paid` — auth: admin
Manual mark-paid (no proof flow). Body:
```json
{ "paymentMethod": "eft" | "paypal" | "cash" | "card" | "other",
  "paidAt": "2026-04-15T...", "reference": "...", "amount": 17250, "proofFileId": "..." }
```

Required: `paymentMethod`. Dispatches `invoice.paid` + `payment.received`. Creates an `activities` entry and notifies invoice creator.

### PayPal

All three require `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` + `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`. Return `503 "PayPal is not configured"` otherwise.

#### `POST /invoices/[id]/paypal-order` — auth: admin
Creates a PayPal order (intent: CAPTURE). Returns:
```json
{ "orderId": "PAY-...", "approveUrl": "https://...", "provider": "paypal" }
```

Stores `paypalOrderId` on invoice.

#### `POST /invoices/[id]/paypal-capture` — auth: admin
Captures the order. Body: `{ orderId: string }` — must match stored order. Marks invoice paid with `paymentMethod: 'paypal'`, `paymentReference: captureId`. Dispatches `invoice.paid` + `payment.received`.

#### `POST /webhooks/paypal` — **public**
PayPal webhook receiver. Verifies signature via PayPal's verify endpoint (requires `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`). Handles:
- `CHECKOUT.ORDER.APPROVED`
- `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED`

Always returns 200 (prevents PayPal retries). Logs failures.

### Recurring schedules

#### `GET /recurring-schedules` — auth: admin
Lists up to 100 schedules, ordered newest first. Query: `status` (`active` by default, or `all`). Restricted admins are filtered to explicit allowed orgs.

#### `PATCH /recurring-schedules/[id]` — auth: admin
Body:
```json
{ "status": "active" | "paused" | "cancelled" }
```

Cannot update a schedule already marked `cancelled`. Create/cancel schedules from the invoice-owned route: `POST /invoices/[id]/recurring` and `DELETE /invoices/[id]/recurring`.

The daily cron `/api/cron/invoices` runs at 2am UTC and generates invoices from active schedules whose `nextDueAt <= now`.

### Expenses

#### `GET /expenses` — auth: admin
Filters: `orgId` (required), `userId`, `status`, `category`, `projectId`, `clientOrgId`, `from`, `to`, `billable`, `billed` (has invoiceId), `page`, `limit`.

#### `POST /expenses` — auth: admin (idempotent)
Required: `date`, `amount`, `category`. Defaults: `currency='ZAR'`, `billable=false`, `reimbursable=true`, `status='draft'`, `userId=current user`.

  "amount": 450,
  "currency": "ZAR",
  "category": "travel",
  "description": "Uber to client meeting",
  "vendor": "Uber",
  "receiptFileId": "file_xyz",
  "projectId": "proj_abc",
  "clientOrgId": "org_client",
  "billable": true,
  "reimbursable": true
}
```

#### `GET/PUT/DELETE /expenses/[id]` — auth: admin
PUT rejects if status is `approved`/`reimbursed`/`rejected` OR `invoiceId` is set (409).

#### `POST /expenses/[id]/submit` — auth: admin
`draft → submitted`. Creates org-wide notification. Dispatches `expense.submitted`.

#### `POST /expenses/[id]/approve` — auth: admin
Body: `{ action: 'approve' | 'reject', note?: string }`.
- `approve`: `status: 'approved'`, `reviewedBy`, `reviewedAt`. Notifies submitter.
- `reject`: `status: 'rejected'`, `rejectionReason=note`, notify submitter.

Requires current status `submitted` (409 otherwise).

#### `POST /expenses/bill` — auth: admin
Bill approved billable expenses to a client invoice.

Body: `{ expenseIds: string[], invoiceId: string }`.

Each expense becomes an invoice line item `{ description: "<category>[: <description>]", quantity: 1, unitPrice: amount, amount }`. Recomputes invoice totals. Sets `invoiceId` on each expense. Batched atomically.

Response: `{ billed: count, invoiceId, newTotal }`.

### Reports (billing-related)

#### `GET /reports/revenue?orgId=X&from=...&to=...&groupBy=month`
Buckets paid invoices by `paidAt`. `groupBy`: `day` | `week` | `month` | `quarter`.

```json
{ "from": "...", "to": "...", "groupBy": "month",
  "buckets": [{ "label": "2026-03", "total": 45000, "count": 8 }],
  "grandTotal": 180000, "currency": "ZAR" }
```

If invoices span multiple currencies, `currency` becomes null and each bucket has `byCurrency: {...}`.

#### `GET /reports/outstanding?orgId=X`
Aged receivables — `sent` / `overdue` / `payment_pending_verification` grouped by `dueDate` age: `0-30`, `31-60`, `61-90`, `90+`.

#### `GET /reports/client-value?orgId=X`
Top clients ranked by lifetime paid total.

#### `GET /reports/expense-summary?orgId=X&from=...&to=...&groupBy=category|project|user`
Expense breakdown.

### Comments on invoices/expenses

```json
POST /comments
{ "orgId": "org_abc", "resourceType": "invoice", "resourceId": "inv_xyz",
  "body": "Client asked to extend due date by 14 days. @user:uid123 please confirm." }
```

## Workflow guides

### 1. EFT payment flow (primary path)

```bash
# 1. Create invoice
POST /invoices
{ "orgId": "org_client", "lineItems": [...], "dueDate": "2026-05-01", "taxRate": 15, "currency": "ZAR" }
# → { id: "inv_xyz", invoiceNumber: "CLI-042" }

# 2. Send it
POST /invoices/inv_xyz/send
# Emails client with public view URL + PDF. Status: sent. Dispatches invoice.sent

# 3. Client views the public invoice page
# (public GET triggers) POST /invoices/inv_xyz/mark-viewed?token=<publicToken>
# Status remains 'sent' but viewedAt/viewCount populate. If first view, status flips to 'viewed'.

# 4. Get payment instructions (to show on public page)
GET /invoices/inv_xyz/payment-instructions
# Returns EFT banking details + reference + publicViewUrl

# 5. Client pays via EFT, uploads proof
POST /invoices/inv_xyz/payment-proof
{ "fileId": "upload_file_id_from_upload_endpoint", "note": "Paid via EFT 15 Apr" }
# Status: payment_pending_verification. Admin gets notification.

# 6. Admin verifies proof
POST /invoices/inv_xyz/confirm-payment
{ "confirmed": true, "paymentMethod": "eft", "reference": "CLI-042", "amount": 17250 }
# Status: paid. Dispatches invoice.paid + payment.received.
```

### 2. PayPal flow (international)

```bash
POST /invoices/inv_xyz/send   # same
# Public invoice page shows PayPal button if available

POST /invoices/inv_xyz/paypal-order
# → { orderId: "PAY-...", approveUrl: "https://..." }
# Redirect client to approveUrl

# After client approves on PayPal:
POST /invoices/inv_xyz/paypal-capture
{ "orderId": "PAY-..." }
# Captures + marks paid.

# OR the webhook path:
# PayPal POSTs to /webhooks/paypal with CHECKOUT.ORDER.APPROVED or PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED
# → automatically marks paid
```

### 3. Recurring monthly invoice

```bash
# Create the template invoice first (keep it in draft)
POST /invoices
{ "orgId": "org_client", "lineItems": [{ "description": "Monthly retainer", "quantity": 1,
  "unitPrice": 15000 }], "taxRate": 15, "currency": "ZAR" }

POST /invoices/inv_template/recurring
{ "interval": "monthly", "startDate": "2026-05-01" }

# Daily cron generates the new invoice at 2am UTC on the schedule
```

### 4. Submit and approve an expense

```bash
POST /expenses
{ "orgId": "org_abc", "date": "2026-04-10", "amount": 450, "currency": "ZAR",
  "category": "travel", "description": "Client meeting", "billable": true,
  "clientOrgId": "org_client", "receiptFileId": "file_xyz" }

POST /expenses/exp_abc/submit   # draft → submitted

POST /expenses/exp_abc/approve
{ "action": "approve" }   # status → approved
```

### 5. Bill billable expenses to a client invoice

```bash
# Create a new invoice or use existing
POST /expenses/bill
{ "expenseIds": ["exp_abc", "exp_def"], "invoiceId": "inv_xyz" }
# Appends line items, recomputes totals, marks expenses billed
```

### 6. Handle overdue invoices

```bash
# Cron /api/cron/invoices runs daily at 2am UTC
# For each invoice where status in ['sent','viewed','payment_pending_verification']
# AND dueDate < now: sets status='overdue', markedOverdueAt, dispatches invoice.overdue

# Check aged receivables
GET /reports/outstanding?orgId=org_abc
```

### 7. Revenue reports

```bash
GET /reports/revenue?orgId=org_abc&from=2026-01-01&to=2026-04-16&groupBy=month
GET /reports/client-value?orgId=org_abc
```

### 8. PiB platform billing views

```bash
# Partners in Biz admin billing page: PiB is sender, clients are recipients.
GET /invoices?view=received&billingOrgId=pib-platform-owner

# A specific client org's received invoice list.
GET /invoices?view=received&orgId=org_client

# Client portal billing tab.
GET /invoices?view=received
GET /quotes?view=received
```

## Error reference

| HTTP | Error | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| 400 | `orgId is required` | Include orgId in body |
| 400 | `At least one line item is required` | Add line items |
| 400 | `Invalid payment method` | Use `eft`/`paypal`/`cash`/`card`/`other` |
| 400 | `Can only approve/reject a submitted expense` | Check status first |
| 404 | `Invoice not found` / `Client organisation not found` | Verify IDs |
| 409 | `Cannot modify a billed entry` / `Cannot delete a billed expense` | Unlink invoice first |
| 503 | `PayPal is not configured` | Set `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` + `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` |

## Agent patterns

1. **Always prefer EFT** — it's cheaper. Only suggest PayPal when client is international.
2. **Check `payment-instructions` before sending** — confirms banking details are populated on the platform org.
3. **Verify proof of payment carefully** — confirm amount + reference match the invoice before confirming.
4. **Use `/invoices/preview` before committing** — lets you show the user the totals first.
5. **Idempotency on creates** — pass `Idempotency-Key: <uuid>` on `POST /invoices` and `POST /expenses`.
6. **Webhooks** — subscribe to `invoice.paid`, `invoice.overdue`, `payment.received` (see `platform-ops`).
7. **Currency consistency** — check client org `settings.currency`; default to `ZAR` for SA clients.
8. **PiB-issued resources** — keep PiB as source/issuer and clients as recipients. For Partners in Biz billing pages, query received invoices by `billingOrgId=pib-platform-owner`, not `orgId=pib-platform-owner`.
