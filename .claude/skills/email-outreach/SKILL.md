# Email Outreach — Partners in Biz Platform API

A complete email marketing system. Eight layers:

1. **Sending** — transactional + drip + broadcast, all through Resend
2. **Templates** — visual block-based builder + starter template library
3. **Sequences** — multi-step drip with delays and variants
4. **Broadcasts** — one-time blasts to segments/lists with optional A/B testing
5. **Audiences** — segments + tags + lead capture forms with double-opt-in
6. **Domains** — per-org sender verification through Resend
7. **AI** — generate emails, sequences, subject variants, and rewrites
8. **Analytics** — per-org / per-broadcast / per-sequence / per-contact dashboards

## Base URL & Authentication

```
https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1
```

```
Authorization: Bearer <AI_API_KEY>
```

Public (no-auth) endpoints — used by hosted forms / web hooks:
- `POST /email/webhook` — Resend delivery webhook receiver
- `POST /capture-sources/[id]/submit` — newsletter / lead capture form submit (CORS open)
- `POST /api/embed/newsletter/[sourceId]/submit` — alias of above
- `GET  /api/embed/newsletter/[sourceId]/widget.js` — embeddable widget JS bundle
- `GET  /embed/newsletter/[sourceId]` — iframe-able signup page
- `GET  /lead/confirm/[token]` — double-opt-in confirmation page

## Crons that drive this skill

- `/api/cron/emails` — every 15 min — sends `scheduled` one-off emails whose `scheduledFor <= now`
- `/api/cron/sequences` — every 15 min — advances active sequence enrollments to the next step
- `/api/cron/broadcasts` — every 15 min — sends `scheduled` broadcasts, resumes mid-flight, finalizes A/B winners, dispatches winner-only fan-out

All cron routes auth via `Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}`.

# 1. Sending

## `POST /email/send` — auth: admin/ai

Send immediately via Resend. Body:
```json
{
  "orgId": "org_xyz",
  "to": "jane@acme.com",
  "cc": ["other@acme.com"],
  "subject": "Welcome to Partners in Biz",
  "bodyText": "Hi Jane,\n\n...\n\nCheers,\nPeet",
  "bodyHtml": "<p>Hi Jane...</p>",
  "contactId": "contact_abc",
  "sequenceId": "seq_xyz",
  "sequenceStep": 2
}
```

Required: `to`, `subject`, `bodyText` OR `bodyHtml`. Missing body is auto-generated from the other.

For contact-linked sends, include `contactId`; the API can derive `orgId` from that contact when the caller omitted org scope. Visual email-builder send tests may also send rendered aliases `{ "html": "...", "text": "..." }`, which are accepted as `bodyHtml` / `bodyText`.

## `POST /email/schedule` — auth: admin/ai

```json
{ ... same as /send, plus: "scheduledFor": "2026-04-20T09:00:00Z" }
```

## `GET /email` — auth: admin

Filters: `status` (`draft|scheduled|sent|failed|opened|clicked`), `direction` (`inbound|outbound`), `contactId`, `sequenceId`, `campaignId`, `broadcastId`, `page`, `limit`.

Admin/agent callers should pass `orgId` for broad email lists. For contact history reads, `GET /email?contactId=<id>&limit=...` can derive org scope from the contact and keeps Firestore index-safe by filtering secondary facets in memory.

## `GET /email/[id]` — auth: admin
## `PUT /email/[id]` — auth: admin — only if `status === 'scheduled'`
## `DELETE /email/[id]` — auth: admin — soft-delete (cancel)

## `POST /email/webhook` — **public**

Resend events handled: `email.delivered`, `email.opened`, `email.clicked`, `email.bounced`, `email.complained`. The webhook:
- updates the matching `emails` doc by `resendId`
- rolls up to `campaigns.stats` / `broadcasts.stats` / variant stats (`broadcasts.ab.variants[i].<field>` / `sequences.steps[n].ab.variants[i].<field>`)
- on `complained` → marks contact `unsubscribed`, pauses all active sequence enrollments for that contact

---

# 2. Visual Email Templates

Block-based email builder. Each template stores an `EmailDocument` = `{ subject, preheader, blocks[], theme }`. Renderer is table-based with inline styles + MSO conditionals → renders consistently in Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail.

Block types: `hero`, `heading`, `paragraph`, `button`, `image`, `divider`, `spacer`, `columns`, `footer`.

5 starter templates ship out-of-the-box: **Weekly newsletter**, **Welcome — day one**, **Product launch**, **Re-engagement**, **Order receipt** — usable as-is or as duplication seeds.

## `GET /email-templates?orgId=...&category=...` — auth: client

Returns merged list of org-specific templates + all starters (starters have `isStarter: true`).

Categories: `newsletter | welcome | product-launch | reengagement | transactional | custom`.

## `POST /email-templates` — auth: client

Body: `{ name, description?, category, document, orgId? }`. Validates the document via the block schema. Returns `{ id }`.

## `GET /email-templates/[id]` — auth: client
## `PUT /email-templates/[id]` — auth: client — starters 403
## `DELETE /email-templates/[id]` — auth: client — starters 403

## `POST /email-templates/[id]/render` — auth: client

```json
{ "vars": { "firstName": "Jane", "company": "Acme", "unsubscribeUrl": "..." } }
```

Returns `{ html, text, subject }` with the template fully interpolated. Use this before sending to preview the final output.

## `POST /email-templates/[id]/duplicate` — auth: client

Copies a template (including starters) into the org library. Returns `{ id }`.

## `POST /email-builder/preview` — auth: client

Stateless render — body `{ document, vars? }` → `{ html, text }`. Used by the visual builder for live preview.

## `POST /email-templates/generate` — auth: client

AI-generates a new template + saves it. Body:
```json
{
  "kind": "newsletter",
  "input": { "topic": "Property launch", "voice": {...}, "stories": [...], "orgName": "Partners in Biz" },
  "orgId": "..."
}
```
Returns `{ id, name, document }`. See AI section below for full input shapes.

---

# 3. Sequences (drip campaigns)

A sequence is an ordered set of steps; each step has `delayDays`, `subject`, `bodyHtml`, `bodyText`, and optionally `ab` (A/B config — see A/B section).

Preferred CRM-scoped endpoints for portal and agent work:

- `GET /crm/sequences` — auth: cookie member+ or Bearer + `X-Org-Id`
- `POST /crm/sequences` — auth: cookie admin+ or Bearer + `X-Org-Id`
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /crm/sequences/[id]`
- `GET/POST /crm/sequences/[id]/enrollments`
- `DELETE /crm/sequences/[id]/enrollments/[enrollmentId]`

Legacy endpoints still exist for admin/property integrations:

## `GET /sequences?orgId=...&status=...` — auth: client
## `POST /sequences` — auth: client

```json
{
  "name": "SaaS Onboarding",
  "description": "5-step welcome + activation",
  "status": "draft",
  "steps": [
    { "stepNumber": 1, "delayDays": 0, "subject": "Welcome {{firstName}}",
      "bodyText": "Thanks for signing up...", "bodyHtml": "..." },
    { "stepNumber": 2, "delayDays": 2, "subject": "Day 2: Get your first value",
      "bodyText": "...", "bodyHtml": "..." }
  ]
}
```

Merge fields: `{{firstName}}`, `{{lastName}}`, `{{fullName}}`, `{{email}}`, `{{company}}`, `{{orgName}}`, `{{unsubscribeUrl}}`, plus any custom fields you supply.

## `GET/PUT/DELETE /sequences/[id]` — auth: client

## `POST /sequences/[id]/enroll` — auth: client

```json
{ "contactId": "..." }            // single
{ "contactIds": ["...", "..."] }  // batch
```

## `GET /sequence-enrollments?sequenceId=...&contactId=...&status=...` — auth: client
## `GET /sequence-enrollments/[id]` — auth: client
## `PATCH /sequence-enrollments/[id]` — auth: client — `{ "status": "paused" | "active" | "completed" }`
## `DELETE /sequence-enrollments/[id]` — auth: client

## `POST /sequences/[id]/generate` — auth: client — AI-generates steps

```json
{
  "name": "Customer onboarding",
  "goal": "Get a SaaS trial user to activate within 14 days",
  "voice": { ... see AI section ... },
  "steps": 5,
  "cadence": "normal",
  "audienceDescription": "...",
  "context": "..."
}
```
Returns `{ updated: true, steps: [...] }` and writes onto the sequence.

## `GET/PUT /sequences/[id]/steps/[stepNumber]/ab` — auth: client

A/B configuration for a single sequence step. See A/B section.

## Sequence capture routing

For CRM capture sources shown at `/portal/capture-sources`, use the CRM capture-source API and `autoSequenceIds` for direct nurture enrollment:

- `GET /crm/capture-sources`
- `POST /crm/capture-sources` with `{ name, type, autoTags?, autoCampaignIds?, autoSequenceIds?, redirectUrl?, consentRequired? }`
- `PUT /crm/capture-sources/[id]` with `{ autoSequenceIds: ["seq_..."] }`
- Public submit path: `POST /api/public/capture/[publicKey]`

On public capture, the platform dedupes contacts by `orgId + email`, applies source tags, and creates idempotent `sequence_enrollments` for each active same-org sequence in `autoSequenceIds` using `campaignId: ""`. Use `autoCampaignIds` when a campaign wrapper is needed for campaign-level stats or audience operations.

---

# 4. Broadcasts (one-time blasts / newsletters)

A broadcast is a single email blast to an audience snapshot. Use this for newsletters, announcements, one-off promotions. For ongoing nurture / multi-step, use a sequence.

## `GET /broadcasts?orgId=...&status=...&limit=...` — auth: client

Statuses: `draft | scheduled | sending | sent | paused | failed | canceled`.

## `POST /broadcasts` — auth: client

```json
{
  "orgId": "org_xyz",
  "name": "Q2 newsletter",
  "description": "Quarterly update",
  "fromDomainId": "domain_abc",
  "fromName": "Peet",
  "fromLocal": "hello",
  "replyTo": "peet@partnersinbiz.online",
  "content": {
    "templateId": "tpl_xyz",
    "subject": "What we shipped this quarter — {{firstName}}",
    "preheader": "5 new features, 3 wins",
    "bodyHtml": "",
    "bodyText": ""
  },
  "audience": {
    "segmentId": "seg_smb",
    "contactIds": [],
    "tags": [],
    "excludeUnsubscribed": true,
    "excludeBouncedAt": true
  }
}
```

Either `templateId` (uses email_templates) OR inline `bodyHtml/bodyText`. Audience: any of segmentId, contactIds, tags — they are merged and de-duped.

## `GET/PUT/DELETE /broadcasts/[id]` — auth: client

PUT only allowed when status in `[draft, paused, scheduled]`.

## `GET /broadcasts/[id]/preview` — auth: client

Returns `{ audienceSize, sampleContacts: [{ email, name, company }, ...] }` — first 5 contacts so you can sanity-check before scheduling.

## `POST /broadcasts/[id]/schedule` — auth: client

```json
{ "scheduledFor": "2026-05-20T09:00:00Z" }
```
Validates content + audience + sender. 422 with array of issues if invalid.

## `POST /broadcasts/[id]/send-now` — auth: client

Sets `scheduledFor: now` — next cron tick picks it up. Or pass `{ "immediate": true }` for synchronous send (max 100 recipients).

## `POST /broadcasts/[id]/test` — auth: client

```json
{ "to": "you@example.com", "vars": { "firstName": "Test" } }
```
Sends a one-off test render. Does NOT enroll anyone or touch stats.

## `POST /broadcasts/[id]/pause` — auth: client
## `POST /broadcasts/[id]/resume` — auth: client

## `GET /broadcasts/[id]/stats` — auth: client

```json
{
  "stats": { "audienceSize": 1245, "sent": 1240, "delivered": 1212, "opened": 488, "clicked": 102, "bounced": 28, "unsubscribed": 3, "failed": 5, "queued": 1240 },
  "rates": { "deliveryRate": 0.977, "openRate": 0.403, "clickRate": 0.084, "bounceRate": 0.023, "unsubRate": 0.0025 }
}
```

## `POST /broadcasts/[id]/generate` — auth: client — AI-generates inline content

```json
{
  "goal": "Announce the property launch to all leads",
  "voice": { ... },
  "contentLength": "medium",
  "cta": { "text": "See the launch", "url": "https://..." }
}
```
Writes subject + preheader + bodyHtml + bodyText onto the broadcast. Refuses 422 if `templateId` is already set.

## `GET/PUT /broadcasts/[id]/ab` — auth: client — A/B config (see below)
## `POST /broadcasts/[id]/ab/start` — auth: client — start winner-only test window
## `POST /broadcasts/[id]/ab/declare-winner` — auth: client — pick winner manually

---

# 5. Campaigns (sequence + audience)

A campaign ties a **sequence** to an **audience** (segment or explicit contact list) and manages enrollment in bulk. Use for multi-touch programs targeting a captured group.

## `GET /campaigns?orgId=...&status=...` — auth: client
## `POST /campaigns` — auth: client

```json
{
  "orgId": "org_xyz",
  "name": "Q2 SMB Nurture",
  "description": "Enroll all SMB leads in the 5-step nurture sequence",
  "fromDomainId": "domain_abc",
  "fromName": "Peet at Partners in Biz",
  "fromLocal": "hello",
  "replyTo": "peet@partnersinbiz.online",
  "segmentId": "seg_smb",
  "contactIds": [],
  "sequenceId": "seq_nurture_5step",
  "triggers": { "captureSourceIds": ["src_newsletter"], "tags": ["smb"] }
}
```

`triggers.captureSourceIds` auto-enrolls anyone captured via those lead-capture forms while the campaign is `active`.

## `GET/PUT/DELETE /campaigns/[id]` — auth: client
## `POST /campaigns/[id]/launch` — auth: client

Resolves audience, bulk-enrolls into the sequence. Skips: unsubscribed, bounced, cross-org, already-enrolled-for-this-campaign.

Response: `{ enrolled: 312, audienceSize: 340 }`.

## `POST /campaigns/[id]/approve-all` — auth: client (content-engine campaigns)
## `POST /campaigns/[id]/schedule` — auth: client (content-engine campaigns — bulk social posts)
## `POST /campaigns/[id]/archive` — auth: client
## `GET  /campaigns/[id]/assets` — auth: client (content-engine campaigns)

---

# 6. Segments & Audiences

## `GET /crm/segments?orgId=...` — auth: client
## `POST /crm/segments` — auth: client

```json
{
  "name": "Active SA SMBs",
  "description": "Captured via newsletter, tagged 'smb', stage 'new' or 'contacted'",
  "filters": {
    "tags": ["smb"],
    "capturedFromIds": ["src_newsletter"],
    "stage": "new",
    "type": "lead",
    "source": "form",
    "createdAfter": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

Filters use AND across keys, OR within `tags`/`capturedFromIds`.

## `GET /crm/segments/[id]` — auth: client
## `PUT /crm/segments/[id]` — auth: client
## `DELETE /crm/segments/[id]` — auth: client
## `GET /crm/segments/[id]/resolve?limit=...` — auth: client

Returns the live contact list matching the segment. Used by campaign/broadcast preview.

---

# 7. Lead Capture (forms, widgets, double-opt-in)

A capture source is a configurable form: define fields, styling, success behaviour, and which sequences/campaigns to auto-enroll on submit. Comes with an embeddable JS widget + iframe.

## `GET /capture-sources?orgId=...&active=...` — auth: client
## `POST /capture-sources` — auth: client

```json
{
  "orgId": "org_xyz",
  "name": "Newsletter — homepage",
  "type": "newsletter",
  "doubleOptIn": "on",
  "confirmationSubject": "Confirm your subscription",
  "confirmationBodyHtml": "<p>Click to confirm: <a href=\"{{confirmUrl}}\">Confirm</a></p>",
  "successMessage": "Check your inbox!",
  "successRedirectUrl": "https://partnersinbiz.online/thanks",
  "fields": [
    { "key": "firstName", "label": "First name", "type": "text", "required": false }
  ],
  "tagsToApply": ["newsletter", "homepage"],
  "campaignIdsToEnroll": [],
  "sequenceIdsToEnroll": ["seq_welcome"],
  "notifyEmails": ["peet@partnersinbiz.online"],
  "widgetTheme": {
    "primaryColor": "#F5A623", "textColor": "#0A0A0B", "backgroundColor": "#ffffff",
    "borderRadius": 12, "buttonText": "Subscribe",
    "headingText": "Get the weekly", "subheadingText": "One email, every Friday. Unsubscribe anytime."
  },
  "active": true
}
```

## `GET/PUT/DELETE /capture-sources/[id]` — auth: client

## `POST /capture-sources/[id]/submit` — **PUBLIC, CORS open**

```json
{ "email": "jane@example.com", "data": { "firstName": "Jane" }, "referer": "https://acme.com/" }
```

Flow:
1. Validates email
2. Creates / updates contact (orgId+email dedup, merges tags)
3. Stores submission
4. If DOI on → sends confirmation email with `{{confirmUrl}}` substituted; returns `{ ok, requiresConfirmation: true, message }`
5. If DOI off → auto-enrolls into sequenceIdsToEnroll + campaignIdsToEnroll + any active campaign whose triggers.captureSourceIds includes this source; sends `notifyEmails`; returns `{ ok, requiresConfirmation: false, message, redirect? }`

Also exposed at `POST /api/embed/newsletter/[sourceId]/submit` for cleaner embed URLs.

## `GET /capture-sources/[id]/submissions?page=...` — auth: client

## Embed surfaces

- **JS widget:** `<script src="https://partnersinbiz.online/embed/newsletter/<SOURCE_ID>/widget.js" async></script>` — renders inline (or pass `data-target="#anchor"` to mount elsewhere)
- **Iframe:** `<iframe src="https://partnersinbiz.online/embed/newsletter/<SOURCE_ID>" width="100%" height="520" style="border:0;max-width:480px"></iframe>`
- **DOI confirmation page:** `https://partnersinbiz.online/lead/confirm/<TOKEN>` — verifies HMAC, marks confirmed, runs auto-enroll

---

# 8. Email Domains (Resend verification)

## `GET /email/domains?orgId=...` — auth: client
## `POST /email/domains` — auth: client — `{ orgId, name }` → returns DNS records to add at registrar
## `GET /email/domains/[id]` — auth: client — refreshes live from Resend (poll until `status === 'verified'`)
## `DELETE /email/domains/[id]` — auth: client — soft-delete + best-effort Resend remove

Use a verified domain's `id` as `fromDomainId` on campaigns / broadcasts so sends go from `<fromLocal>@<domainName>`.

---

# 9. AI Email Generation

All generators use the same multi-kind `/email/generate` endpoint with a discriminated body.

## `POST /email/generate` — auth: client (admin/ai)

Common shape:
```json
{
  "kind": "email" | "subjects" | "sequence" | "newsletter" | "winback" | "rewrite",
  "input": { ... },
  "orgId": "org_xyz"   // optional — if set + voice not provided, voice is loaded from organizations.settings.brandVoice
}
```

### `kind: "email"` — single email

```json
{
  "kind": "email",
  "input": {
    "goal": "Follow up with cold lead after Properties demo",
    "voice": { "tone": "founder-led", "audience": "SA SMB founders", "doNotUseWords": ["leverage","supercharge"], "sampleLines": ["Most agencies juggle five tools..."], "signOff": "— Peet" },
    "audienceDescription": "SMB founder who saw the demo last week",
    "context": "They were comparing us to Mailchimp + Webflow + GA",
    "contentLength": "medium",
    "cta": { "text": "Book a 15-min call", "url": "https://cal.com/peet" },
    "outputMode": "inline"

{ "subject": "...", "preheader": "...", "bodyHtml": "...", "bodyText": "...", "modelUsed": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6", "generatedAt": "2026-05-11T..." }
```

For `outputMode: "document"`, returns `{ subject, preheader, document: EmailDocument, modelUsed, generatedAt }` — drop straight into `/email-templates`.

### `kind: "subjects"` — subject-line variants (A/B candidates)

```json
{ "kind": "subjects", "input": { "topic": "Properties launch", "voice": {...}, "count": 5, "body": "optional existing body" } }
```
Returns `{ subjects: ["...", "...", ...], modelUsed }`. Uses Haiku 4.5 for speed.

### `kind: "sequence"` — full nurture series

```json
{
  "kind": "sequence",
  "input": {
    "name": "Cold lead nurture",
    "goal": "...",
    "voice": {...},
    "steps": 5,
    "cadence": "normal",
    "audienceDescription": "...",
    "context": "..."
  }
}
```
Returns `{ name, description, steps: [{stepNumber, delayDays, subject, bodyHtml, bodyText}, ...], modelUsed }`.

### `kind: "newsletter"` — block-based newsletter

```json
{
  "kind": "newsletter",
  "input": {
    "topic": "What we shipped this quarter",
    "voice": {...},
    "stories": [
      { "heading": "...", "bodyHint": "...", "ctaText": "Read more", "ctaUrl": "...", "imageUrl": "..." }
    ],
    "orgName": "Partners in Biz",
    "unsubscribeUrl": "..."
  }
}
```
Returns `{ document, subject, preheader, modelUsed }` — an `EmailDocument` ready to save as a template.

### `kind: "winback"` — re-engagement

```json
{
  "kind": "winback",
  "input": {
    "contactName": "Jane",
    "contactCompany": "Acme",
    "daysSinceLastInteraction": 90,
    "lastTopicOrProduct": "Properties module",
    "voice": {...},
    "offer": { "description": "30% off COMEBACK30 for the next 14 days", "ctaText": "Reactivate now", "ctaUrl": "..." }
  }
}
```

### `kind: "rewrite"` — improve an existing body

```json
{
  "kind": "rewrite",
  "input": {
    "body": "...existing html or text...",
    "voice": {...},
    "instruction": "tighten" | "expand" | "soften" | "sharpen" | "translate-sa-english"
  }
}
```

### Voice presets (`lib/ai/voice-presets.ts`)

- `PIB_FOUNDER_VOICE` — direct, founder-led, SA English (default)
- `WARM_PROFESSIONAL` — friendly, polished service-business voice
- `BOLD_STARTUP` — startup pitch energy
- `CLINICAL_AUTHORITY` — law/health/finance
- `PLAYFUL_BRAND` — consumer / e-commerce

Pass any of these as `input.voice`. Or call `voiceFromOrg(orgId)` server-side / let the endpoint do it by passing top-level `orgId`.

### Targeted generators

- `POST /sequences/[id]/generate` — generates steps and PATCHes them onto the sequence
- `POST /broadcasts/[id]/generate` — generates inline content and writes to the broadcast
- `POST /email-templates/generate` — saves the result as a new `email_templates` doc

---

# 10. A/B Testing

A/B is configured on **broadcasts** (whole-email) and **sequence steps** (per-step). Variants override one or more of: subject, body, fromName, sendTime.

Two modes:
- **`split`** — all variants sent, weights sum to 100, optionally auto-promote winner after `testDurationMinutes`
- **`winner-only`** — variants sent only to a `testCohortPercent` of audience; after `testDurationMinutes` the system picks a winner and fans out to the remaining audience

## `GET/PUT /broadcasts/[id]/ab` — auth: client

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "mode": "winner-only",
  "variants": [
    { "id": "a", "label": "Short subject", "overrides": [{ "kind": "subject", "subject": "What we shipped this quarter" }], "weight": 50, "sent": 0, "delivered": 0, "opened": 0, "clicked": 0, "bounced": 0, "unsubscribed": 0 },
    { "id": "b", "label": "Question subject", "overrides": [{ "kind": "subject", "subject": "What did we ship this quarter, Jane?" }], "weight": 50, "sent": 0, "delivered": 0, "opened": 0, "clicked": 0, "bounced": 0, "unsubscribed": 0 }
  ],
  "testCohortPercent": 20,
  "winnerMetric": "opens",
  "testDurationMinutes": 240,
  "autoPromote": true,
  "status": "inactive",
  "winnerVariantId": "",
  "testStartedAt": null, "testEndsAt": null, "winnerDecidedAt": null
}
```

PUT validates: enabled needs ≥2 variants; split mode requires weights sum to 100; winner-only requires testCohortPercent 1-50, testDurationMinutes ≥ 5. Only editable while broadcast in `draft` or `paused`.

## `POST /broadcasts/[id]/ab/start` — auth: client

Marks `ab.status = 'testing'` and stamps `testStartedAt` + `testEndsAt`. Use for winner-only mode after scheduling.

## `POST /broadcasts/[id]/ab/declare-winner` — auth: client

```json
{ "variantId": "a" }   // manual
{}                      // auto-pick from current stats
```

Sets `ab.winnerVariantId`, transitions `ab.status = 'winner-pending'`. Next cron tick dispatches winner to the remaining audience.

## `GET/PUT /sequences/[id]/steps/[stepNumber]/ab` — auth: client

Same shape, scoped to a single sequence step.

Variant assignment is deterministic (HMAC of `contactId + ':' + broadcastId`) — re-running the same broadcast picks the same variant per contact.

```

## `GET /email-analytics/broadcasts/[id]` — auth: client
Per-broadcast detail (KPIs + timeline + topClicks + topDomains).

## `GET /email-analytics/sequences/[id]` — auth: client
Per-sequence identity, status breakdown, step funnel, and agent-ready optimization guidance.

Returns:
- `sequence`: `{ id, name, description, status, stepsCount }`
- `totalEnrollments`, `byStatus`, `averageCompletionDays`
- `stepFunnel`: per-step sent/open/click/drop-off metrics
- `insights`: completion/open/click rates, `weakestStepNumber`, and `nextActions` for agents/operators

Portal users can reach sequence reporting from `/portal/email-analytics`: active `/crm/sequences` appear in the `Sequence performance` list and link to `/portal/email-analytics/sequences/[id]`. Use that drilldown to inspect enrollment status, active/completed counts, average completion days, step-level sent/open/click/drop-off data, and the `Agent next moves` recommendations. Agents should use `insights.nextActions` as the starting checklist when optimizing a sequence.

## `GET /email-analytics/contacts?orgId=...&status=highly-engaged|engaged|cooling|dormant|unsubscribed|bounced&limit=...` — auth: client

Engagement-scored contacts (score 0..100). Status buckets derived from score + recency.

## `GET /email-analytics/leaderboard?from=...&to=...` — auth: **admin/ai only**

Cross-org leaderboard — open rate / click rate / bounce rate per org. Platform-admin tool.

## `GET/PUT/DELETE /links/[id]` — auth: client (slug immutable)
## `GET /links/[id]/stats` — auth: client — clicks, referrers, countries, day/hour buckets

Public route `/l/<slug>` logs the click + 302s to targetUrl.

# Workflow guides (agent-ready recipes)

## 1. Newsletter signup widget on a client's marketing site

```bash
# Create the capture source
POST /capture-sources
{ "orgId":"acme", "name":"Newsletter — homepage", "type":"newsletter",
  "doubleOptIn":"on", "successMessage":"Check your inbox!",

# → { id: "seq_abc" }

# Have AI fill it in
POST /sequences/seq_abc/generate
{ "name":"SaaS onboarding", "goal":"Get a trial user to activate in 14 days",
  "voice": <PIB_FOUNDER_VOICE>, "steps":5, "cadence":"normal" }

# Activate
PUT /sequences/seq_abc { "status":"active" }

    {"id":"b","label":"Question","overrides":[{"kind":"subject","subject":"<question>"}],"weight":50,"sent":0,"delivered":0,"opened":0,"clicked":0,"bounced":0,"unsubscribed":0}
  ]}

# Sanity-check the audience
GET /broadcasts/bc_abc/preview
# → { audienceSize: 1245, sampleContacts: [...] }

# Schedule
POST /broadcasts/bc_abc/schedule { "scheduledFor":"2026-05-15T09:00:00Z" }

# Start the A/B window once it goes 'scheduled' — the cron will dispatch the test cohort first
POST /broadcasts/bc_abc/ab/start

# 4h later the cron auto-picks the winner and fans out to the remaining 80%.
# Or manually:
POST /broadcasts/bc_abc/ab/declare-winner { "variantId":"a" }

# Watch it
GET /broadcasts/bc_abc/stats
GET /email-analytics/broadcasts/bc_abc
```

## 4. Verify a custom sending domain

```bash
POST /email/domains { "orgId":"acme", "name":"mail.acme.com" }
# → { id, dnsRecords:[...] }

# Add each record at the registrar, then poll:
GET /email/domains/dom_acme
# Repeat until status === 'verified'
```

## 5. Send a one-off email with a tracked CTA

```bash
POST /links { "targetUrl":"https://acme.com/landing?utm_source=email&utm_campaign=apr", "slug":"apr" }
# → { shortUrl: "https://partnersinbiz.online/l/apr" }

POST /email/send
{ "to":"jane@acme.com", "subject":"Quick follow-up",
  "bodyHtml":"<p>Hi Jane, ...<a href=\"https://partnersinbiz.online/l/apr\">See the offer</a></p>",
  "contactId":"contact_abc" }

# Later
GET /links/<id>/stats
```

## 6. Re-engagement campaign for cooling contacts

```bash

# → array with contactIds

# Generate a winback email
POST /email/generate
{ "kind":"winback",
  "input":{ "contactName":"{{firstName}}", "daysSinceLastInteraction":60,
    "voice":<PIB_FOUNDER_VOICE>,
    "offer":{"description":"30% off COMEBACK30 for the next 14 days","ctaText":"Reactivate","ctaUrl":"https://..."} } }

# Save as a one-shot broadcast and send-now
POST /broadcasts
{ "orgId":"acme", "name":"Winback April",
  "content":{ "subject":"<from above>", "bodyHtml":"<from above>", "bodyText":"<from above>", "templateId":"", "preheader":"" },
  "audience":{ "segmentId":"", "contactIds":<from analytics>, "tags":[], "excludeUnsubscribed":true, "excludeBouncedAt":true }, ... }

# Agent patterns

1. **Always link `contactId`** on `/email/send` so the contact's activity timeline is clean.
2. **Voice presets are your shortcut** — pass `PIB_FOUNDER_VOICE` for PiB-style; or supply `orgId` and the endpoint loads `org.settings.brandVoice` if defined.
3. **Use templates over inline HTML.** Build once via the visual builder, reference by `templateId` on every broadcast — far easier to maintain.
4. **Preview before sending.** `POST /email-templates/[id]/render` + `GET /broadcasts/[id]/preview` together tell you exactly who gets exactly what.
5. **Generate subject variants for every broadcast** — `POST /email/generate {kind:"subjects"}` then wire the top 2 into `/ab` config. Use `mode:"winner-only"` with `autoPromote:true` for hands-off A/B.
6. **Newsletter signup must use DOI.** GDPR / SA POPI compliance + better deliverability + cleaner list.
7. **Watch the bounce + complaint rates.** A single complaint flags; 3+ in 7 days → pause sending and investigate. `GET /email-analytics/overview` shows `bounceRate` and `unsubRate`.
8. **Tracked links on every CTA.** `POST /links` first, then embed `shortUrl` — automatic click attribution.
9. **Segment + tag — not raw contactIds — for ongoing programs.** A segment evaluates fresh on each campaign launch; a contactIds list is frozen at the time of POST.
10. **`fromDomainId` must be `verified`.** Sends from an unverified domain fall back to the shared PiB domain — fine for early experiments, bad for client-branded sends.
11. **Idempotency**: every POST that creates a resource supports `Idempotency-Key` header. The broadcast cron is itself idempotent (`emails` collection has a unique `broadcastId+contactId` invariant — the cron skips already-sent contacts).
12. **A/B is deterministic per contact.** Re-running a paused/restarted broadcast routes each contact to the same variant. No double-counting.
13. **Engagement score (0..100)** = `opens × 5 + clicks × 15 − bounces × 30 − daysSinceLastEngaged × 0.5`, clamped. Use the `cooling`/`dormant` status filters on `/email-analytics/contacts` to find your winback audience.
14. **No raw HTML in starters.** All 5 starter templates use the block model — easier to AI-edit, easier to remix per-org.
15. **The complete capture → enroll loop:** `/capture-sources/[id]/submit` (public) → contact + tags applied → DOI confirm if on → auto-enroll all matching sequences + active campaigns whose `triggers.captureSourceIds` includes the source. No glue code needed.

# v3 features (2026-05-11 world-class build)

Twelve additional layers on top of the v2 platform. Every surface is agent-callable.

## 13. Deliverability hardening

- **List-Unsubscribe + List-Unsubscribe-Post (RFC 8058 one-click)** — `sendCampaignEmail` accepts `listUnsubscribeUrl`; every broadcast/sequence/transactional send now sets `List-Unsubscribe: <url>` and `List-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click`. Required by Gmail/Yahoo bulk-sender rules.
- **Bounce categorization** — webhook reads `data.bounce.{type,subType}`. Hard → permanent suppression + `contact.bouncedAt`. Soft → temporary 24h suppression (contact stays sendable after expiry). Complaint → permanent suppression + full unsubscribe.
- **Suppression list** — `suppressions` collection keyed by `${orgId}_${lowercase(email)}`. Reasons: `hard-bounce | soft-bounce | complaint | manual-unsub | list-cleanup | invalid-address | disposable-domain`. Scopes: `permanent | temporary`. Routes:
  - `GET /api/v1/suppressions?orgId=...&reason=...` — list
  - `POST /api/v1/suppressions` — admin add
  - `DELETE /api/v1/suppressions/[id]` — admin remove
  - `GET /api/v1/suppressions/check?orgId=...&email=...` — `{ suppressed, reason, scope, expiresAt }`
- **Send pipelines refuse suppressed addresses** — `lib/broadcasts/audience.ts` filters via `getSuppressedEmails`; `sendSmsToContact` and `sendBroadcastToContact` and the sequences cron all call `isSuppressed` before sending.
- **Webhook svix verification** — `app/api/v1/email/webhook` enforces `svix-id/timestamp/signature` headers against `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Soft-fails with warning in dev when secret unset; MANDATORY in prod.

## 14. Spam protection on lead capture

`CaptureSource` extended with:
```ts
turnstileEnabled: boolean
turnstileSiteKey: string
honeypotEnabled: boolean             // default true
blockDisposableEmails: boolean       // default true (40+ burner domains)
rateLimit: { enabled: boolean; maxPerHourPerIp: number; maxPerDayPerEmail: number }
```

- Cloudflare Turnstile widget injected into JS bundle + iframe; verified server-side via `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`.
- Honeypot `_hp` field included in every form (CSS-hidden). Filled = silent success (fool the bot).
- Rate limit state in `lead_capture_rate_limits` collection, deterministic keys.
- Disposable email check via `lib/lead-capture/disposable-domains.ts > isDisposableEmail`.
- Block stats incremented on `source.stats.blocked.{honeypot,rateLimit,disposable,captcha}`.
- Admin "Spam protection" tab in CaptureSourceEditor.

## 15. Preferences center + frequency capping

Instead of binary unsubscribe, contacts pick topics + frequency.

- **`SubscriptionTopic`** per-org config in `org_preferences_config/{orgId}` — list of topics + page copy + default frequency.
- **`ContactPreferences`** in `contact_preferences/{contactId}` — `topics: Record<topicId, boolean>`, `frequency: 'all'|'weekly'|'monthly'|'transactional-only'|'none'`.
- **Preferences page** at `/preferences/[token]` — same HMAC token as unsubscribe. Server-rendered form works without JS.
- **`shouldSendToContact({ contactId, orgId, topicId? })`** — SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for "can I send to this contact". Every cron/send path calls it.
- **Frequency cap** in `organizations.settings.frequencyCap`: `maxPer7Days` (default 7), `maxPer24Hours` (default 3), `exemptTopics: ['transactional']`.
- **`isWithinFrequencyCap(orgId, contactId, topicId)`** — counts emails in last 24h/7d, excludes exempt topics. Frequency-skipped sends logged to `frequency_skips`.
- **`topicId`** added to Broadcast, Sequence, and Email docs.

Routes:
- `GET/PUT /api/v1/orgs/[orgId]/preferences-config`
- `GET /api/v1/orgs/[orgId]/preferences-config/recent-unsubs`
- `GET/PUT /api/v1/orgs/[orgId]/frequency-cap`
- `GET/PUT /api/v1/contacts/[id]/preferences`

Footer block auto-injects `{{preferencesUrl}}` when not explicitly set.

## 16. broadcast_recipients drain (A/B winner-only fix)

The broadcast cron's main loop now drains `broadcast_recipients` after the main loop. For A/B winner-only mode, deferred contacts pending the winner now actually get the winner variant sent. Idempotent via existing `(broadcastId, contactId)` emails-doc check. Cron response includes `recipientsDrained`/`recipientsFailed`/`recipientsSkipped`.

## 17. Reply tracking (Resend Inbound)

- **Webhook:** `POST /api/v1/email/inbound-webhook` (public, svix-verified).
- **Collection:** `inbound_emails` — one doc per received message with intent classification.
- **Classifier:** header-aware (`Auto-Submitted`, `X-Autoreply`, `Precedence`, `X-Failed-Recipients`, DSN Content-Type) + subject prefix + body unsubscribe-phrase scan.
- **5 intents:**
  - `reply` — auto-pauses active `sequence_enrollments` with `exitReason: 'replied'`, bumps `contact.lastRepliedAt` + `repliesCount`
  - `auto-reply` — log only, no pause
  - `bounce-reply` — adds soft-bounce suppression, marks `contact.bouncedAt`
  - `unsubscribe-reply` — full unsub + permanent manual-unsub suppression + pause all enrollments
  - `unknown` — log + notify admins via `org.settings.replyNotifyEmails`
- **Admin UI:** `/admin/email/inbound` list + detail with intent badges.

**Config required:** Create a Resend Route in dashboard forwarding inbound `reply.<sending-domain>` to `https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1/email/inbound-webhook`. Set sequence/broadcast `replyTo` to that address.

## 18. Send-time optimization (timezone-aware)

- **Org-level:** `OrgSettings.preferredSendHourLocal` (default 9), `preferredSendDaysOfWeek` (default `[1,2,3,4,5]` Mon-Fri).
- **Per-contact override:** `Contact.timezone` (IANA).
- **Sequences cron:** `nextSendAt = pickSendTime(now + delayDays, ctx)` — DST-correct via `Intl.DateTimeFormat` roundtrip (no offset-string math).
- **Broadcast local delivery:** new `broadcast.audienceLocalDelivery` + `localDeliveryWindowHours` (default 24). When on, cron defers contacts whose local clock hasn't reached the broadcast hour. After windowHours expires, sends regardless. Admin: "Deliver at recipient's local time" checkbox in BroadcastEditor Schedule tab.

## 19. Behavioral segmentation

`SegmentFilters` extended (all OPTIONAL — old segments keep working):

```ts
behavioral?: BehavioralRule[]      // AND across rules
engagement?: EngagementScoreRule
```

- **8 ops × 7 scopes:** `has-opened|has-not-opened|has-clicked|has-not-clicked|has-received|has-not-received|has-replied|has-not-replied` × `any-email|broadcast|campaign|sequence|sequence-step|topic|link-url`.
- **Engagement filter:** min/max score (0-100), `lastEngagedWithinDays`, `notEngagedWithinDays`.
- **Live preview:** `POST /api/v1/crm/segments/preview` returns `{ count, sample }` without persisting.
- **7 predefined recipes** in `lib/crm/predefined-segments.ts`: Highly engaged / Cooling / Dormant / New & active / Never engaged / Clicked but didn't reply / Newsletter-only. Use as templates in the UI.

## 20. Branching sequences + goal-based exit + wait-until

`SequenceStep` extended with OPTIONAL `branch?: SequenceBranch` and `waitUntil?: WaitUntil`. `Sequence` extended with optional `goals?: SequenceGoal[]`.

- **Branch conditions:** `opened | not-opened | clicked | not-clicked | clicked-link | contact-has-tag | contact-at-stage | replied | days-since-step | goal-hit`.
- **Wait-until:** `business-hours | day-of-week | contact-tag-added | contact-stage-reached | goal-hit`. With `maxWaitDays` + `onTimeout: 'send' | 'exit'`.
- **Goals:** checked before every step. Hit → exit with custom `exitReason` (e.g. `'converted'`).
- **Cycle guard:** `visitedSteps[]` on enrollment; revisit triggers `exitReason: 'cycle-detected'`.
- **Path audit trail:** `path: EnrollmentPathEntry[]` on enrollment records every step + branch decision.
- **`pendingBranchEvalAt`** on enrollment — two-phase send → wait → branch flow.

Routes:
- `PATCH /api/v1/sequences/[id]/steps/[stepNumber]` — set branch/waitUntil
- `PUT /api/v1/sequences/[id]/goals` — set sequence goals
- `GET /api/v1/sequence-enrollments/[id]/path` — view contact's journey

Admin UI: ConditionPicker, BranchEditor, WaitUntilEditor, GoalsEditor components + `SequenceTreeView` visualization.

## 21. Pre-send preflight validation

Catches mistakes BEFORE sending.

Checks: subject length, missing alt text, broken/empty link URLs, low-contrast text, missing unsubscribe link, oversize images, banned-word audit.

Routes:
- `POST /api/v1/broadcasts/[id]/preflight` — returns `{ errors[], warnings[], passed }`
- `POST /api/v1/sequences/[id]/steps/[stepNumber]/preflight` — same for a sequence step

Admin: `PreflightPanel` component in BroadcastEditor + sequence step editor. Schedule button disabled if errors present.

## 22. A/B statistical significance

`lib/ab-testing/stats.ts > selectWinner` now respects `minSampleSize` (default 100 per variant). Returns null until both variants have enough data. Optional chi-squared test reports confidence level. Manual override still works via `POST /broadcasts/[id]/ab/declare-winner { variantId }`.

## 23. Image upload + brand kit + conditional content + reusable snippets

- **Image upload:** `POST /api/v1/email-images/upload` — multipart upload to Firebase Storage, returns CDN URL. Used by builder image block.
- **Brand kit:** `GET/PUT /api/v1/brand-kit` per-org store of logo URL, primary/secondary/accent colors, font family, custom voice, default footer. Auto-applied to new templates via `applyToDocument`.
- **Conditional content blocks:** every block now supports `condition?: BlockCondition` — show/hide based on contact tag, stage, custom field, or merge-var presence. Renderer evaluates per-recipient.
- **Reusable snippets:** save a block tree as a named snippet, reuse across templates. CRUD via `/api/v1/email-snippets`. Pre-built snippets in `snippet-presets.ts` (header / footer / hero card / CTA bar / social row).

## 24. Popup / exit-intent / multi-step capture widgets

`CaptureSource.display: WidgetDisplayConfig` with 5 modes:

- **inline** (default) — current behavior
- **popup** — modal after `triggerDelaySeconds` or `triggerScrollPercent`; optional `triggerOnExitIntent`
- **slide-in** — small toaster from `position: bottom-right | bottom-left | top-right | top-left`
- **exit-intent** — fires on mouseleave (desktop) or popstate (mobile)
- **multi-step** — collects email first, then progressive profiling on subsequent steps

Per-mode controls: `dismissCooldownDays` (default 7), `suppressForSubscribedDays` (default 365), `showOnPaths` / `hideOnPaths` (glob patterns), `triggerPagesViewed`. Frequency state in `localStorage` under `pib_lc_<sourceId>_*`.

- `POST /api/v1/capture-sources/[id]/progressive` — partial multi-step submits (captures email on step 1 even if user bails on step 2).
- Admin "Display & triggers" tab in CaptureSourceEditor with live preview iframe.

## 25. AMP for Email + dark mode + interactive blocks

4 new AMP block types:

- `amp-carousel` — multi-image slider with autoAdvance
- `amp-accordion` — expandable FAQ sections
- `amp-form` — capture inside the email (no click-through needed)
- `amp-live-data` — fetch live JSON at render time

HTML fallbacks for non-AMP clients (first slide, fully-expanded accordions, "Click to subscribe" buttons).

- **AMP renderer:** `lib/email-builder/render-amp.ts > renderAmpEmail(doc, vars)` returns `null` if no AMP blocks (skip AMP entirely).
- **Dark mode:** `<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">` + `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` CSS overrides + MSO Outlook 365 `[data-ogsc]` selectors. Theme override `darkMode: 'auto' | 'force-light'`.
- **AMP validation:** `validateAmp(ampHtml)` checks for AMP 4 Email boilerplate before send.

## 26. Advanced analytics

5 new endpoints + 4 new dashboard tabs:

- **Cohort retention:** `GET /api/v1/email-analytics/cohort?orgId=...&from=...&to=...&weeksToShow=12` — % of each signup-week cohort engaged in each subsequent week.
- **Revenue attribution:** `GET /api/v1/email-analytics/revenue` (overview) + `GET /revenue/[source]/[sourceId]`. Auto-attributes on deal `won` and invoice `paid`. Stored in `email_attributions` keyed by `${orgId}_${conversionId}`.
- **Click heatmap:** `GET /api/v1/email-analytics/broadcasts/[id]/heatmap` — link-by-link click stats with position in email.
- **Send-time matrix:** `GET /api/v1/email-analytics/send-time-matrix?orgId=...&from=...&to=...` — 7×24 grid of openRate per (day, hour) in org timezone. Includes `bestDay`/`bestHour` recommendation (min 10 samples per cell).
- **Industry benchmarks:** `GET /api/v1/email-analytics/benchmarks?orgId=...&industry=...&from=...&to=...` — compares org's rates to industry medians (newsletter/ecommerce/saas/agency/nonprofit/b2b/media/finance/health) and to org's own 30-day rolling baseline. Reports p25/p50/p75 percentile bucket per metric.

Dashboard tabs: Cohorts (heatmap table), Revenue (KPIs + topPerformingEmails + topPerformingSources), Send time (7×24 grid with best-time recommendation), Benchmarks (3-column comparison).

## 27. SMS via Twilio + multi-channel sequences

- **Library:** `lib/sms/twilio.ts` (SDK wrapper + `isValidE164` / `normalizeToE164` / `countSmsSegments`), `lib/sms/send.ts > sendSmsToContact` (preferences gate + suppression + activity log + stats roll-up).
- **`Sms` collection** with same shape patterns as `emails`: direction, twilioSid, status, segmentsCount, costEstimateUsd, contactId, sequenceId, broadcastId, topicId, variantId.
- **Contact extensions:** `phoneVerified?`, `smsOptedIn?`, `smsUnsubscribedAt?`.
- **Suppression extended with `channel: 'email' | 'sms'`.**
- **Multi-channel sequence steps:** `SequenceStep.channel: 'email' | 'sms'` + `smsBody`. Cron dispatches on channel.
- **Multi-channel broadcasts:** `Broadcast.channel: 'email' | 'sms'`. SMS broadcasts use `content.bodyText` as the SMS body. A/B variants also apply to SMS.
- **Routes:**
  - `POST /api/v1/sms/send` — send (ad-hoc or contact-aware)
  - `GET  /api/v1/sms` / `GET /api/v1/sms/[id]` — list/detail
  - `POST /api/v1/sms/webhook` — PUBLIC, Twilio-signature verified. Handles STOP/HELP/START keywords (TwiML responses for HELP, suppression+confirmation for STOP).
  - `POST /api/v1/sms/status-webhook` — PUBLIC, status callbacks (sent → delivered/failed/undelivered). Rolls up broadcast/campaign stats. Adds SMS suppression on hard-fail Twilio error codes (21610 = STOP, 21211/21408/21614/30003-30008 = hard).
- **AI SMS generator:** `POST /api/v1/email/generate { kind: 'sms', input: { goal, voice, cta?, maxSegments? } }` — uses BRIEF_MODEL (Haiku) since SMS is short.
- **Admin UI:** channel toggle in BroadcastEditor + sequence step editor. SMS view shows segment counter (chars · segments · GSM7/UCS2).
- **Env required:** `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_MESSAGING_SERVICE_SID`, `TWILIO_DEFAULT_FROM_NUMBER`.

## v3 agent patterns

16. **Always check preflight before scheduling.** `POST /broadcasts/[id]/preflight` catches broken links, missing alt text, missing unsubscribe.
17. **Use the preferences gate.** `shouldSendToContact` is the canonical "may I send?" check — your custom code should NEVER bypass it.
18. **Suppression list is the single source of truth.** Don't query `contacts.bouncedAt` directly — `isSuppressed(orgId, email, channel?)` covers all reasons + temporary/permanent.
19. **Multi-channel = email + SMS** in one sequence. Step 1 email, step 2 SMS, step 3 email again. Set `channel: 'sms'` + `smsBody` on the step.
20. **Behavioral segments evaluate live.** `POST /crm/segments/preview` is your debug tool — never schedule a broadcast without checking the count.
21. **Local delivery beats global timestamp** for newsletters. `audienceLocalDelivery: true` + `localDeliveryWindowHours: 24` sends at 9am wherever each contact is.
22. **Branching beats linear** for nurture. After a key email, branch on opened/clicked/replied → different paths.
23. **Goals exit aggressively.** When the goal of the sequence is achieved (deal won, demo booked), stop sending. Set `sequence.goals[]`.
24. **A/B needs ≥100 samples per variant** before the auto-winner picks. Don't trust 5-vs-4 splits.
25. **Industry benchmarks calibrate your reporting.** `GET /email-analytics/benchmarks` answers "is 22% open rate good?" with the right context.
26. **Cohort retention reveals churn.** A cohort that drops from 40% engaged in week 1 to 5% by week 4 = welcome series isn't activating. Watch week-1 retention closely.
27. **Send-time matrix > "always 9am".** After 100+ sends, `GET /send-time-matrix` shows when YOUR contacts actually open. Often surprising.
28. **For Resend Inbound:** add the Route in the dashboard before relying on reply tracking. Point `replyTo` at the routed address.
29. **For Twilio Webhooks:** configure inbound + status callback URLs in Messaging Service settings. `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` enforces signature verification.
30. **For Cloudflare Turnstile:** site key embeds publicly in the widget; secret key (`TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY`) stays server-side.
