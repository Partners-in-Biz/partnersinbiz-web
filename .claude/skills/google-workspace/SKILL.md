# Google Workspace — Binary Artifact Storage

This skill governs how agents store, retrieve, and share **binary artifacts** — images, videos, PDFs,
brand kits, ad creatives, reports, contracts, and any other non-text file generated during client
work. Text knowledge (specs, briefs, research, plans) lives in Obsidian. Code lives in GitHub.
Everything else lives in Google Drive.

## The Three-Tier Rule

Get the file type right or it ends up invisible to other agents and to the client.

| File type | Canonical location | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Specs, plans, briefs, research dumps, architecture docs | `~/Cowork/Cowork/agents/<domain>/wiki/` | Obsidian syncs to VPS + mobile; searchable by all agents |
| Code, READMEs, ADRs, in-tree config, skill files | Project git repo | Version-controlled; not synced to Obsidian or Drive |
| **Binary artifacts** — images, videos, PDFs, brand kits, ad creatives, signed contracts, invoices, renders, exports | **Google Drive** (`My Drive/Clients/<Client>/...`) | Drive is the canonical binary store; shareable directly with clients |

The full table and symlink rules live in `/Users/peetstander/Cowork/CLAUDE.md` under "Where to put agent-generated files". Read that if you're unsure about a file type.

**Rule of thumb:** if the file would corrupt in a markdown editor or break in a git diff, it goes to Drive.

---

## Per-Client Folder Convention

Every client gets a root folder under `My Drive/Clients/`. Use this structure exactly — the numbered
prefixes ensure stable sort order and predictable paths for programmatic access.

```
My Drive/
└── Clients/
    └── <Client Name>/          e.g. "Loyalty Plus", "AHS Law", "Lumen"
        ├── 01_brand/           logo files, font licences, brand kit PDF, colour palettes
        ├── 02_marketing/       ad creatives, video edits, social images, campaign packs
        │   └── <campaign>/     sub-folder per campaign, e.g. "black-friday-2026"
        ├── 03_deliverables/    final reports, signed contracts, invoices, strategy docs as PDF
        └── 04_raw-sources/     clipped PDFs, screenshots, datasets, reference files
```

### Discovering or creating a client folder

1. Call `drive_search` with `q: "<Client Name>"` and a known parent `folderId` when available to find the root.
2. If it exists, use the returned folder ID for all child operations.
3. If it does not exist, ask Peet/operator for the correct client folder or create folders through Workspace Broker (`POST /workspace-broker/folders/create`) when that task is approved. Do not try to create folders with `drive_upload`; the direct upload endpoint uploads files only.
4. Always use the folder **ID** (not the path string) for subsequent operations — paths are not stable across renames.

---

## Operations

These are the tool contracts agents call through the PiB platform proxy. The direct proxy endpoints
are implemented in `partnersinbiz-web` on `development` as of 2026-06-15.

All calls require normal PiB API auth plus an org scope:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer $AI_API_KEY
X-Org-Id: <ORG_ID>
```

You may pass `orgId` in the query/body instead of `X-Org-Id`, but do not send conflicting org values.

---

### `drive_list` — list files in a folder

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <ORG_ID>" \
  "https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1/google/drive/list?folderId=<FOLDER_ID>&pageSize=50"
```

Query params:
- `orgId` or `X-Org-Id` (required)
- `folderId` (required) — Drive folder ID. Prefer explicit shared client folder IDs.
- `pageSize` — default 50, max 200
- `pageToken` — cursor for next page
- `includeFolders` — `true` to include folders; otherwise folders are hidden

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "files": [
      { "id": "1abc...", "name": "logo-v3.png", "mimeType": "image/png",
        "size": "204800", "webViewLink": "https://drive.google.com/...",
        "modifiedTime": "2026-05-13T10:00:00Z", "parents": ["folder_abc"] }
    ],
    "nextPageToken": "token_abc"
  }
}
```

---

### `drive_upload` — upload a local file to Drive

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <ORG_ID>" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/file.png" \
  -F "folderId=<FOLDER_ID>" \
  -F "name=logo-v3.png" \
  "https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1/google/drive/upload"
```

Fields (multipart/form-data):
- `file` (required) — binary file, max 5 GB
- `folderId` (required) — destination folder ID
- `name` — override filename; defaults to original filename
- `mimeType` — override MIME type; defaults to uploaded file type or `application/octet-stream`

JSON upload is also supported for small generated text artifacts:
```json
{ "orgId": "org_abc", "folderId": "folder_abc", "name": "notes.txt", "mimeType": "text/plain", "content": "hello" }
```
Use `contentBase64` instead of `content` when binary bytes must travel through JSON.

Response (201):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "1abc...",
    "name": "logo-v3.png",
    "mimeType": "image/png",
    "webViewLink": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1abc.../view",
    "parents": ["folder_abc"]
  }
}
```

Use `webViewLink` for sharing with humans. Use `drive_download` for programmatic download.

---

### `drive_download` — download a file by ID

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <ORG_ID>" \
  "https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1/google/drive/download?fileId=<FILE_ID>" \
  -o output.png
```

Query params:
- `fileId` (required)
- `exportMimeType` — for Google Workspace files (Docs/Sheets/Slides), specify export MIME: `application/pdf`, `text/plain`, etc.

Response: raw binary stream with appropriate `Content-Type`.

---

### `drive_share` — share a file or folder with an email address

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <ORG_ID>" \
  -d '{
    "fileId": "1abc...",
    "emailAddress": "client@example.com",
    "role": "reader",
    "sendNotificationEmail": true
  }' \
  "https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1/google/drive/share"
```

Body fields:
- `fileId` (required)
- `emailAddress` (required) — recipient email
- `type` — `user` or `group`; defaults to `user`
- `role` — `reader` | `commenter` | `writer`; defaults to `reader`
- `sendNotificationEmail` — default `false`; set `true` to notify

Response:
```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "id": "perm_abc", "type": "user", "role": "reader", "emailAddress": "client@example.com" } }
```

The proxy deliberately rejects `type: "anyone"` public shares. Share folders or files only with
explicit users/groups unless Peet approves a different route.

---

### `drive_search` — full-text + filename search across Drive

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <ORG_ID>" \
  "https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1/google/drive/search?q=brand+kit&folderId=<FOLDER_ID>"
```

Query params:
- `orgId` or `X-Org-Id` (required)
- `q` (required) — search string (searches filename and full text)
- `folderId` — restrict to a known shared folder ID
- `pageSize` — default 50, max 200
- `pageToken` — cursor for next page

Response: same shape as `drive_list`.

The `q` param is forwarded to the Drive API's `fullText contains` + `name contains` operator, OR'd together.

---

### `docs_create` — create a new Google Doc with optional content

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <ORG_ID>" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Q3 Strategy Report — Loyalty Plus",
    "content": "# Q3 Strategy\n\n## Goals\n...",
    "folderId": "<FOLDER_ID>"
  }' \
  "https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1/google/docs/create"
```

Body:
- `title` (required)
- `content` — optional plain text inserted at the top of the document
- `folderId` — where to place the Doc; if omitted, Google creates it in the service-account default root

Response (201):
```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "documentId": "1xyz...", "title": "Q3 Strategy Report — Loyalty Plus",
  "webViewLink": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xyz.../edit" } }
```

Use this when a deliverable is best consumed as a living Google Doc rather than a PDF. For
static exports, generate the Doc then use `drive_download` with `exportMimeType=application/pdf`.

---

### `sheets_append` — append a row to a Google Sheet

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <ORG_ID>" \
  -d '{
    "spreadsheetId": "1abc...",
    "range": "Sheet1",
    "values": [["2026-05-13", "Loyalty Plus", "Black Friday Pack", "Done", "https://drive.google.com/..."]]
  }' \
  "https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1/google/sheets/append"
```

Body:
- `spreadsheetId` (required)
- `range` (required) — sheet name or A1 range (e.g. `Sheet1`, `Deliverables!A:E`)
- `values` (required) — 2D array; each inner array is one row

Response:
```json
{ "success": true, "data": { "spreadsheetId": "1abc...", "updates": { "updatedRange": "Sheet1!A10:E10", "updatedRows": 1 } } }
```

---

### `sheets_read` — read a range from a Google Sheet

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <ORG_ID>" \
  "https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1/google/sheets/read?spreadsheetId=1abc...&range=Sheet1!A1:E20"
```

Query params:
- `spreadsheetId` (required)
- `range` (required)

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "spreadsheetId": "1abc...",
    "range": "Sheet1!A1:E20",
    "values": [
      ["Date", "Client", "Asset", "Status", "Drive URL"],
      ["2026-05-13", "Loyalty Plus", "Black Friday Pack", "Done", "https://drive.google.com/..."]
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## Auth Model

**Current state: platform endpoints are implemented; credential and folder setup may still be incomplete.**

Auth flows as follows:

- **Mac / Claude Code sessions:** service account JSON at `~/.config/gcloud/workspace-sa.json` is picked up by the PiB API. Agents never hold Drive credentials directly.
- **VPS (Hermes):** service account JSON at `/etc/hermes/google-drive-sa.json` (mode 600), used by `rclone` for direct Drive mounts and by the PiB API proxy when the VPS calls platform endpoints.
- **All agent calls go through the PiB platform:** `Bearer $AI_API_KEY` → `https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1/google/...` → PiB API authenticates to Drive using the stored service account. Agents never handle OAuth tokens directly.
- **Env vars:** use `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CREDS_JSON_PATH` for Mac/VPS file paths and `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CREDS_JSON` for Vercel/serverless raw service-account JSON. Do not point Vercel at `/etc/hermes/...`; that file exists only on the VPS.

The service account must be granted access to specific client folders only — never the entire Drive. Share each `My Drive/Clients/<Client>/` root folder with the service account email. This is the least-privilege posture.

---

## When NOT to Use This Skill

| Situation | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Writing a spec, plan, brief, research dossier, or architecture doc | Obsidian — `~/Cowork/Cowork/agents/<domain>/wiki/` |
| Writing code, configs, or skill files | Git — commit to the project repo |
| Creating a short text summary of work done | Include inline in the kanban task's `agentOutput.summary` |
| Uploading a social post image to the PiB platform (not Drive) | `POST /api/v1/social/media/upload` via the social-media-manager skill |

Drive is for artifacts that need to be **shared with clients as files** or that are too large/binary for git or Obsidian. If it's text and it fits in a markdown file, it does not belong in Drive.

---

## Kanban Artifact Embed Pattern

When an agent generates a binary artifact and stores it in Drive, the Drive URL must be written back
to the kanban task so the Agent Board UI can surface it. Use the `agentOutput.artifacts` array on
the task PATCH:

```bash
PATCH /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/tasks/{taskId}
{
  "agentOutput": {
    "summary": "Generated 5 Black Friday social image variants and uploaded to Drive.",
    "artifacts": [
      { "type": "url", "ref": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1abc.../view", "label": "Black Friday — Square v1" },
      { "type": "url", "ref": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xyz.../view", "label": "Black Friday — Stories v1" }
    ],
    "completedAt": "2026-05-13T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "agentStatus": "done"
}
```

Artifact schema: `{ type: 'url' | 'file' | 'commit' | 'message-thread' | 'doc', ref: string, label?: string }`.

The Agent Board UI renders `type: 'url'` artifacts as clickable links. Always label them clearly —
"Brand kit v3", "Q3 Report PDF", "Black Friday — Square 1024x1024" — so the human knows what
they're clicking before they open Drive.

---

## End-to-End Example — Social Pack for a Client

Maya is asked to "create a Black Friday social pack for Loyalty Plus":

1. **Generate assets** — Maya calls `higgsfield-generate` or `higgsfield-product-photoshoot` to produce 5 image variants.

2. **Find the client folder** — call `drive_search` with `q: "Loyalty Plus"` and a known parent folder ID if available. If none is found, ask Peet/operator for the correct shared folder or create it through Workspace Broker with approval.

3. **Upload each image** — call `drive_upload` once per image, targeting `Clients/Loyalty Plus/02_marketing/black-friday-2026/` by folder ID.

4. **Share with client** — call `drive_share` on the campaign sub-folder (not individual files) with `emailAddress: <client email>`, `role: 'reader'`, `sendNotificationEmail: true`. One share permission covers the whole campaign folder.

5. **Write back to kanban** — PATCH the task with `agentStatus: 'done'` and `agentOutput.artifacts` containing all 5 Drive view URLs. Include the folder share link as an additional artifact labeled "Campaign folder — Loyalty Plus Black Friday".

6. **Brief Peet or the operator** — surface the folder URL in your response so the human can see it without opening the kanban.

---

## VPS-Side Access

Hermes agents on `hermes-vps-01` (Helsinki, Hetzner CX23) access the same Drive via two paths:

- **PiB API proxy** — agents call `https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1/google/...` with `Bearer $AI_API_KEY` exactly as Mac-side agents do. Same auth, same endpoints. Preferred for standard operations once the production runtime has `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CREDS_JSON` or `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CREDS_JSON_PATH`.
- **`rclone` remote** — VPS `gdrive:` is configured for the `hermes` user and can upload/read Drive files directly. Use this for VPS-local binary artifacts when the API proxy is blocked by missing Vercel Google credentials or when uploading large files from `/var/lib/hermes/outputs`.

Both paths should target the same Drive workspace, but they use different credentials. Do not assume the
PiB API proxy is live just because `rclone` works, and do not assume the `hermes` user can use a root-only
rclone config. Verify from the agent user:

```bash
sudo -iu hermes bash -lc 'rclone about gdrive: >/dev/null && echo gdrive-ok'
```

For a VPS-local artifact upload:

```bash
sudo -iu hermes bash -lc '
  rclone copyto /var/lib/hermes/outputs/<run>/<file> "gdrive:PiB Agent Research/outputs/<run>/<file>"
  rclone link "gdrive:PiB Agent Research/outputs/<run>/<file>"
'
```

The verified 2026-06-15 system video path is:

```text
gdrive:PiB Agent Research/outputs/pib-system-video-2026-06-15/partners-in-biz-system.mp4
```

---

## Operator Setup — Finish Credential Activation

The PiB API routes are implemented. Follow these steps to activate real Drive access if they have
not already been completed.

### Step 1 — GCP project

Use the existing GCP project `partners-in-biz-85059` or create a new one. If reusing, check that Drive/Docs/Sheets APIs are not already enabled before enabling them (avoids duplicate billing).

### Step 2 — Enable APIs

In the GCP console (or via `gcloud`):
```bash
gcloud services enable drive.googleapis.com docs.googleapis.com sheets.googleapis.com \
  --project=partners-in-biz-85059
```

### Step 3 — Create a service account

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create workspace-agent \
  --display-name="Hermes Workspace Agent" \
  --project=partners-in-biz-85059

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create workspace-sa.json \
  --iam-account=workspace-agent@partners-in-biz-85059.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Note the service account email — you will use it to share Drive folders.

### Step 4 — Place the key securely

- **Mac:** `cp workspace-sa.json ~/.config/gcloud/workspace-sa.json && chmod 600 ~/.config/gcloud/workspace-sa.json`
- **VPS:** `scp workspace-sa.json hermes-vps-01:/etc/hermes/google-drive-sa.json && ssh hermes-vps-01 chmod 600 /etc/hermes/google-drive-sa.json`
- Delete the local `workspace-sa.json` after copying — do not leave it in any git-tracked path.

### Step 5 — Share client folders with the service account

For each client, share their root Drive folder with the service account email and grant **Editor** role. Do this in the Google Drive web UI (or via the Drive API). Never share the entire Drive — folder-level sharing only.

Example:
```
Share "My Drive/Clients/Loyalty Plus" → workspace-agent@partners-in-biz-85059.iam.gserviceaccount.com → Editor
Share "My Drive/Clients/AHS Law"      → same email → Editor
```

### Step 6 — Set the env var

On Mac (`.env.local`):
```
GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CREDS_JSON_PATH=/Users/peetstander/.config/gcloud/workspace-sa.json
```

On VPS profile/service env:
```bash
GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CREDS_JSON_PATH=/etc/hermes/google-drive-sa.json
```

On Vercel, store the raw JSON as a secret env var:
```bash
printf "%s" "$(cat /secure/path/workspace-sa.json)" | vercel env add GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CREDS_JSON preview
printf "%s" "$(cat /secure/path/workspace-sa.json)" | vercel env add GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_CREDS_JSON production
```

Use `vercel env ls` to verify the variable name exists. The value is encrypted and should not be printed.

### Step 7 — Configure rclone on VPS (optional but recommended)

```bash
# On hermes-vps-01
rclone config create gdrive drive \
  service_account_file=/etc/hermes/google-drive-sa.json \
  scope=drive
```

Test: `rclone ls gdrive:Clients/Loyalty\ Plus/01_brand/`

If `root` has a working `gdrive:` remote but `hermes` does not, copy only the rclone config file into
the hermes account with locked-down permissions:

```bash
install -d -m 700 -o hermes -g hermes /var/lib/hermes/.config/rclone
install -m 600 -o hermes -g hermes /root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf /var/lib/hermes/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
sudo -iu hermes bash -lc 'rclone about gdrive:'
```

### Step 8 — Smoke test

```bash
# Upload a test file
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <ORG_ID>" \
  -F "file=@/tmp/test.txt" \
  -F "folderId=<SHARED_FOLDER_ID>" \
  -F "name=drive-integration-test.txt" \
  "https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1/google/drive/upload"

# List the same shared folder
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $AI_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Org-Id: <ORG_ID>" \
  "https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1/google/drive/list?folderId=<SHARED_FOLDER_ID>"
```

If both return 200, the integration is live. Delete the test file and update this section.

---

## Agent Patterns

1. **Search before creating** — always call `drive_search` to check if a client folder exists before creating a new one. Duplicate folders are hard to clean up at scale.
2. **Share folders, not files** — when giving a client access to a campaign, share the campaign sub-folder. Individual file shares create noise in Drive and are harder to revoke.
3. **Name files with version and date** — `brand-kit-v3-2026-05.pdf` not `brand-kit-final-FINAL.pdf`. Clients rename things; the version in the filename is the source of truth.
4. **Always write artifacts to kanban** — a Drive URL that isn't in `agentOutput.artifacts` is invisible to Peet and to other agents. Never skip this step.
5. **Binary artifacts = Drive; text knowledge = Research/Obsidian** — if you're tempted to put a markdown file in Drive, stop. Working client research belongs in the Research module first, then selected durable summaries can be exported to the wiki.
