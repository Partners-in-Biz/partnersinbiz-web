# Client Documents

Use this whenever Peet asks for a proposal, spec, strategy document, sign-off, report, change request, approval pack, or any client-facing document.

## What This Is

`client_documents` are the collaboration and approval layer between PiB and clients. They live at:
- Admin view: `https://partnersinbiz.online/admin/documents/[id]`
- Org-scoped admin: `https://partnersinbiz.online/admin/org/[slug]/documents/[id]`
- Client portal: `https://partnersinbiz.online/portal/documents/[id]`
- Public share page: `https://partnersinbiz.online/d/[shareToken]` (only after publish)

Projects, campaigns, CRM deals, reports, SEO sprints, and social posts remain the operational source of truth. Documents are linked to them via `document.linked`.

---

## CRM Relationship Model

Document ownership, CRM-company linkage, and client organisation visibility are separate.

- `orgId` is the document source/owner workspace.
- `linked.companyId` attaches the document to a CRM company and is required for company Documents tabs.
- `linked.clientOrgId` makes a PiB-owned document visible in a system client's organisation document views once the status is client-visible.
- Existing documents should not be re-owned just to make them appear in another view. Link them with `linked.companyId` and, where applicable, `linked.clientOrgId`.
- PiB-prepared documents for system clients should normally be source-owned by `pib-platform-owner` and linked to the client through `linked.companyId` + `linked.clientOrgId`.
- Non-system CRM businesses have no client organisation. For them, use `linked.companyId` only; they show under the CRM company Documents tab but not in any client portal Documents tab.

When creating from a CRM company page, prefer the current page company context:

```json
{
  "title": "AHS Law — Google Ads Proposal",
  "type": "sales_proposal",
  "templateId": "sales_proposal",
  "linked": { "companyId": "<crmCompanyId>" }
}
```

The API resolves the owner org from the company. If that company has `linkedOrgId`, the API also stamps `linked.clientOrgId`, so the client organisation sees the document after publish.

When creating from a selected client/org context instead of a company page, send the client `orgId`. The API finds the PiB-side platform CRM company and stores the document under `pib-platform-owner` when that relationship exists.

Publishing / "send to client" changes the document to `client_review`, enables share, and makes it appear in client-visible document lists. Client-visible statuses are only `client_review`, `changes_requested`, `approved`, and `accepted`; `internal_draft` and `internal_review` stay hidden from clients.

After publishing a CRM-linked client document, verify it through both views:

1. CRM company Documents tab includes the document via `linked.companyId`.
2. Client/org Documents list includes it via `linked.clientOrgId` and client-visible status.

Do not rely on email notification alone as proof of client visibility; verify the document list/API.

---

## Share modes

A document supports two independent shares — view-only and edit. They are independently revocable.

### View-only share (`/d/[shareToken]`)

Public, no authentication required. Anyone with the link can see the document. Enable by publishing the document. Use for: pitch decks, signed-off proposals, final reports anyone can read.

### Edit share (`/d/[editShareToken]/edit`)

Code-gated + authenticated. Recipients must:
1. Enter the 6-character access code admin generated
2. Sign in via magic-link email OR Google OAuth
3. (Their identity is captured so every comment, suggestion, or edit is recorded against a verified email)

What they can do once authenticated is controlled by `document.clientPermissions` (comments, suggestions, direct edits, approvals — independently toggleable).

Use for: client review cycles, collaborative editing with external stakeholders, anyone whose feedback you need to attribute.

| `type` / `templateId` | Label | Approval mode | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sales_proposal` | Sales Proposal | `formal_acceptance` | New client pitches, SOW-level agreements |
| `build_spec` | Website/App Build Spec | `operational` | Web/app project scopes |
| `social_strategy` | Social Media Strategy | `operational` | Social channel + content strategies |
| `content_campaign_plan` | Content Campaign Plan | `operational` | Campaign briefs, asset plans |

## Block Types

Each document version is an ordered array of `DocumentBlock` objects. Fill `content` based on block type:

| Block type | Content shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `hero` | `string` (subtitle / tagline) | Always first. Title comes from `document.title`. |
| `summary` | `string` (markdown prose) | Executive summary or overview |
| `problem` | `string` (markdown prose) | Problem statement, audience pain, context |
| `scope` | `string` or `string[]` (bullet list) | What is in scope |
| `deliverables` | `string[]` (list of deliverables) | Concrete outputs |
| `timeline` | `{ phases: [{ label: string, duration: string, description?: string }] }` | Milestone phases |
| `investment` | `{ items: [{ label: string, amount: number, currency?: string }], total: number, currency?: string, notes?: string }` | Pricing table |
| `terms` | `string` (markdown prose) | Payment terms, IP, cancellation |
| `approval` | `string` (instructions text for client) | Shown above the approve button |
| `metrics` | `{ items: [{ label: string, value?: string, target?: string, description?: string }] }` | KPIs / success metrics |
| `risk` | `string[]` or `string` | Known risks, assumptions, limitations |
| `table` | `{ headers: string[], rows: string[][] }` | Generic data table |
| `gallery` | `string[]` (image URLs) | Image gallery |
| `callout` | `{ title: string, body: string, variant?: 'info'\|'warning'\|'success' }` | Highlighted callout box |
| `rich_text` | `string` (markdown) | Free-form markdown section |
| `image` | `{ url, alt?, caption?, width?: 'normal'\|'wide'\|'full' }` | Lazy-loaded; `wide` breaks past prose column, `full` is edge-to-edge |
| `video` | `{ url, provider?: 'youtube'\|'loom'\|'vimeo'\|'mux', caption? }` | Auto-detects provider from URL; lazy iframe |
| `embed` | `{ url, height?: number, caption? }` | Sandboxed iframe; only allowed hosts (Calendly, Tally, Typeform, Figma, CodeSandbox, Google Docs/Forms) — others fall back to a plain link |
| `link_card` | `{ url, title, description?, image?, favicon? }` | OG-style card with hover lift and hostname badge |
| `chart` | `{ kind: 'bar'\|'pie'\|'line'\|'progress_ring', data, title?, options? }` | Recharts; auto-themed from accent palette |
| `pricing_toggle` | `{ items: [{label, amount, required?, default?}], currency, note? }` | Interactive — client toggles add-ons, total updates live |
| `faq` | `{ items: [{q, a}] }` | Native `<details>` accordion |
| `comparison` | `{ headers: string[], rows: [{label, values: (string\|boolean)[]}], highlightCol?: number }` | Highlight column tinted accent; boolean cells render as check/cross icons |

**Display motion options (optional):** `none` | `reveal` | `sticky` | `counter` | `timeline`
- Use `reveal` on most prose/list blocks (fade-and-slide on scroll into view)
- Use `counter` on `metrics` blocks (animates numeric values from 0 → target on scroll)
- Use `sticky` on `hero` for parallax effect
- Use `timeline` on `timeline` blocks for sequential phase reveal

---

## Status Flow

```
internal_draft → internal_review → client_review → changes_requested → approved → accepted
                                                                       ↑_________↓ (loop)
```
- `internal_draft` / `internal_review`: not visible to client
- `client_review`: client can see and comment (requires publish)
- `changes_requested`: client requested changes via portal
- `approved`: operational approval given
- `accepted`: formal acceptance signed (proposals only)
- `archived`: soft-deleted from active views

Research reports follow the same status flow, but keep them internal unless Peet has approved client visibility and the report has passed the research checklist: source ledger is safe to expose, confidence/assumptions are explicit, sensitive internal notes are removed, recommendations do not imply unapproved spend/publishing/implementation, and the linked `research_item` visibility is appropriate.

## Default Agent Workflow

### Internal system/spec document → approval-gated kanban breakdown

Use this for substantial client work when Peet says to plan/spec something before implementation, especially coding, multi-agent work, operational setup, or anything that affects cost, timeline, scope, or the client's live assets.

1. Resolve the active relationship context first. If the current app page is a CRM company, use that company ID. If the context is only a selected client org, resolve its PiB-side platform CRM company when one exists.
2. Create the client document as `internal_draft` or `internal_review`. For CRM-company work, send `linked.companyId`; for system clients also include/verify `linked.clientOrgId`. Link to the active project with `linked.projectId` when a project exists.
3. Record assumptions on the document. Any assumption that changes scope, price, timeline, legal terms, final deliverables, or implementation direction must be `severity: "blocks_publish"`.
4. If there is any `blocks_publish` assumption, do not ask Peet to approve or publish the spec as ready. Return the admin URL and the blocking assumption(s) to resolve first.
5. Create a Pip approval-gate kanban task linked to the document/spec.
6. Break specialist work into project tasks only after the spec is approved, or create the tasks early but hold every agent task at `agentStatus: "awaiting-input"` with `dependsOn: [approvalTaskId]`.
7. Important gotcha: project task creation may initialise agent tasks as `pending` even if `awaiting-input` was sent. Immediately PATCH each gated agent task back to `awaiting-input`, then verify with `GET /projects/[projectId]/tasks` before telling Peet the task fan-out is gated.
8. When Peet/PiB approves the spec, release the dependent agent tasks by patching them to `agentStatus: "pending"`; the kanban watcher then picks them up automatically. Do not manually start implementation before the approval gate is cleared.
9. After the document is sent to the client, fetch open comments and suggestions before acting on an approval. Treat unresolved client feedback as input to a new document version or a change-request task, not as noise.
10. Only release implementation tasks after client feedback is either incorporated, explicitly rejected with a reason, or converted into a blocker/change-request task.

### Client comments/suggestions → revised spec loop

When a shared spec has client feedback:

1. `GET /api/v1/client-documents/[id]/comments?status=open`
2. `GET /api/v1/client-documents/[id]/suggestions?status=open`
3. Summarise the feedback into: accepted changes, rejected changes with reasons, open blockers, and questions for Peet/client.
4. Create a new document version for accepted changes with `changeSummary` explaining the review pass.
5. Resolve comments only after the relevant document version or task exists.
6. If feedback changes implementation scope, update/hold/recreate kanban tasks before releasing agents.

### "Make a proposal for [Client]"

1. **Resolve relationship context:** prefer the current CRM company page/context. If not already on a company, find the organisation (`GET /api/v1/organizations?search=[client_name]`) and its PiB-side CRM company. For non-system CRM businesses, there is no `orgId`; use the company only.
2. **Pull context:** CRM company profile, linked org profile when present, open CRM deals, projects, wiki at `~/Cowork/Cowork/agents/partners/wiki/`
3. **Choose template:** proposal → `sales_proposal`, website/app → `build_spec`, etc.
4. **Create document:**
   ```
   POST /api/v1/client-documents
   X-Org-Id: <orgId>
   {
     "title": "[Client Name] — [Type] [Month YYYY]",
     "type": "sales_proposal",
     "templateId": "sales_proposal",
     "orgId": "<orgId if creating from org context>",
     "linked": {
       "companyId": "<crmCompanyId>",
       "clientOrgId": "<linkedOrgId if system client>",
       "dealId": "<dealId if known>"
     }
   }
   ```
   If you are creating directly from a CRM company page, `orgId` can be omitted; the API resolves the source org from `linked.companyId` and stamps `linked.clientOrgId` from the company relationship when available.
5. **Create first version** with filled blocks (you have all 23 block types available — see "Example Payloads" below):
   ```
   POST /api/v1/client-documents/[id]/versions
   X-Org-Id: <orgId>
   {
     "blocks": [ ...filled blocks array... ],
     "theme": {
       "brandName": "<org.name>",
       "palette": { "bg": "#0A0A0B", "text": "#F7F4EE", "accent": "#F5A623" },
       "typography": { "heading": "sans-serif", "body": "sans-serif" }
     },
     "changeSummary": "Initial agent-generated draft"
   }
   ```
   Use brand colors from org profile if available.
5b. **If this is a proposal**, also include a `video` block (Loom intro), a `comparison` block, a `pricing_toggle` block, and an `faq` block for maximum impact. See "Make a Standout Proposal" below.
6. **Mark open assumptions:**
   ```
   PATCH /api/v1/client-documents/[id]
   {
     "assumptions": [
       { "id": "price", "text": "Investment amount TBC", "severity": "blocks_publish", "status": "open", "createdBy": "agent" },
       { "id": "timeline", "text": "Start date to confirm with client", "severity": "needs_review", "status": "open", "createdBy": "agent" }
     ]
   }
   ```
7. **Return to Peet:**
   - Admin URL: `https://partnersinbiz.online/admin/documents/[id]`
   - Summary of `blocks_publish` assumptions that must be resolved before you can publish
   - Never publish without Peet's explicit instruction
8. **Publish/send to client:** only after blockers are resolved and Peet approves, call `POST /api/v1/client-documents/[id]/publish`. This moves the document to `client_review` and enables share. For system clients, verify both the PiB CRM company Documents tab and the client/org Documents list.

---

## Assumptions Guide

Use `assumptions[]` whenever context is incomplete. Severity:

| Severity | When to use |
|---|---|
| `blocks_publish` | Price, legal terms, binding dates, final scope, client name/address on contract |
| `needs_review` | Positioning copy, wording, references, estimates, optional sections |
| `info` | FYI notes that don't need action |

Always draft first. The document is safe to show Peet with open assumptions. Never publish (`POST .../publish`) without resolving all `blocks_publish` items first.

---

## Filling Blocks Well

**hero:** Write a one-line value proposition or document purpose as the subtitle. Example: `"A clear path to a faster, more discoverable web presence."`

**problem:** Describe the client's current situation and pain in 2–4 sentences. Be specific. Reference their industry, current tools, and what they're missing.

**scope:** Bullet list of what is included. Be explicit. Include tech stack, integrations, environments (staging + prod), etc.

**deliverables:** Concrete, countable outputs. "1 × Next.js website", "3 × Figma design rounds", "Monthly performance reports for 3 months".

**timeline:** Use realistic phase names: Discovery → Design → Build → QA → Launch. Include durations like "1 week", "2 weeks".

**investment:** Always in ZAR unless client is international. Include a line-item breakdown and a total. Add a `notes` field for payment schedule.

**terms:** Reference PiB standard: 50% upfront, 50% on launch. IP transfers on final payment. 30-day support post-launch.

**metrics:** For strategy docs: reach, engagement rate, follower growth, leads generated. For build docs: Lighthouse scores, Core Web Vitals, uptime.

## Make a Standout Proposal

Default proposals are fine. *Standout* proposals close. When generating a `sales_proposal`, layer in these blocks for outsized impact:

1. **Lead with a video block** (Loom intro from Peet) — placed right after the hero. A 60–180s personal walkthrough is hugely differentiating. Use `provider: 'loom'` and put it before the `summary` block.
2. **Use a comparison block** to anchor against alternatives. "PiB vs in-house hire vs other agency" or "DIY vs done-for-you." Highlight the PiB column with `highlightCol: 1` so it visually wins.
3. **Use pricing_toggle for upsells / optional add-ons.** The client toggles add-ons live and watches the total update — it makes optional spend feel like a choice, not a push. Always mark the base package `required: true, default: true`.
4. **Use an faq block** to pre-empt the top 3–5 objections **before** the approval block. Common ones: "what if it doesn't work?", "who owns the IP?", "can we pause?", "why not in-house?". Answering them in writing removes the last reason to delay.
5. **Investment block auto-renders an allocation chart** when there are 2+ line items — so just put 5 line items in and it'll look great with no extra effort. Aim for: setup, monthly fee, ad spend, creative, reporting.
6. **Metrics block auto-renders progress rings** when both `value` and `target` are set. Use this for "current vs target" stat displays — perfect for the "what we'll hit" section. **IMPORTANT: `value` and `target` MUST be strings (`"0"`, `"180"`), NOT integers (`0`, `180`). The renderer calls `.replace()` on these values and will crash with `TypeError: e.replace is not a function` if you pass integers.**
7. **Set `motion: 'counter'` on metrics blocks** so numbers animate from 0 → final value on scroll. Set `motion: 'reveal'` on prose blocks (summary, problem, scope, deliverables, callout, risk). Set `motion: 'timeline'` on the timeline block for sequential phase reveal.

**Recommended order for a standout sales proposal:**
1. `hero` (motion: reveal)
2. `video` — Loom intro
3. `summary` (motion: reveal)
4. `problem` (motion: reveal)
5. `scope` (motion: reveal)
6. `deliverables` (motion: reveal)
7. `comparison` — PiB vs alternatives
8. `timeline` (motion: timeline)
9. `metrics` (motion: counter) — what we'll hit
10. `investment` — 5 line items so the chart auto-renders
11. `pricing_toggle` — optional add-ons
12. `callout` — guarantee / risk reversal
13. `faq` — objections pre-empted
14. `terms`
15. `approval`

## Cross-References

- **research-intelligence** skill creates structured `research_items` first. Use `research_report` documents only when research needs polished client presentation, approval, or shareable output. Link reports with `linked.researchItemIds`.
- **content-engine** skill creates `content_campaign_plan` documents automatically
- **project-management** skill links documents to projects via `linked.projectId`
- **crm-sales** skill links proposals to deals via `linked.dealId`
- **crm-sales/company context** links documents to CRM companies via `linked.companyId`; system-client visibility also needs `linked.clientOrgId`.
- **seo-sprint-manager** skill can link sprint reports via `linked.seoSprintId`

## Sharing a document with a client (recommended flow)

After creating a proposal/spec/report draft:

1. If the client just needs to read: publish the document. Share `https://partnersinbiz.online/d/<shareToken>` — public, no friction.
2. If you want them to comment / approve / suggest changes:
   - Enable edit share: `POST /api/v1/client-documents/[id]/edit-share/enable`
   - Copy the URL (`/d/<editShareToken>/edit`) and the access code from the response
   - Send them both — typically the URL in your message and the code in a separate channel for some belt-and-braces security
   - They sign in via magic link or Google, then have whatever permissions the document allows
3. Watch the access log (`GET /api/v1/client-documents/[id]/access-log`) to see who's viewed + when
4. Comments + suggestions show up in the document's review rail in admin
5. Revoke at any time: regenerate the code, or disable the share entirely
