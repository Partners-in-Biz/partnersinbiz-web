# Agent Runtime Ops — Partners in Biz Platform API

Admin/VPS orchestration for named agents and their Hermes profile links, agent memory
subsystem, Loop Engine internals, runtime/provider health verification, and linked-computer
pairing. This is **not** ordinary client-facing task API surface — these routes inspect and
operate agent runtimes on Peet's behalf. Use them only when asked to manage agents, inspect
agent health/logs/files/skills, apply skill policy, control a Hermes run/job, review loop
telemetry, diagnose a provider outage, or pair/adopt a linked computer.

## Related skills

- `platform-ops` — general platform primitives (API keys, health, webhooks, files, search, notifications, comments)
- `platform-admin-users` — Platform Users (staff) super-admin CRUD
- `system-auth` — auth/delegation mint & resolve rules

## Auth (mandatory)

Interactive Hermes runs use the **user-delegation** token injected by Messages / minted via `system-auth` (`Authorization: Bearer pib_dlg_…` + `X-Org-Id`).

- Prefer the injected delegation token for all `/api/v1/*` calls in a human-triggered run.
- `AI_API_KEY` / agent system keys are **cron/system only**.
- Never claim a write succeeded without read-back (see pack `verificationContract` / skill success gate).
- See skill `system-auth` for mint/resolve rules.

## Base URL & Authentication

```
https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1
```

```
Authorization: Bearer <AI_API_KEY>
```

Prefer the user-delegation Bearer token (`pib_dlg_…`) for interactive/human-triggered runs, or per-agent `pib_ag_...` keys from Firestore `api_keys` for VPS Hermes profiles. The legacy shared `AI_API_KEY` is a cron/system-only fallback.

For AI/agent bearer requests to tenant-scoped routes, also send:

```
X-Org-Id: <orgId>
```

## API Reference

### Agent memory (hybrid lookup + reindex)

#### `POST /agent/lookup` — auth: admin/agent
Hybrid memory lookup for agents. Use this for questions like "get me the client called John" or "what context do we have around this company?"

Body:
```json
{
  "query": "client John",
  "orgId": "org_abc",
  "sourceTypes": ["obsidian", "crm_contact", "crm_company"],
  "limit": 8,
  "requestingUserId": "uid_123",
  "delegationEvidenceId": "delegation_abc"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "intent": "entity_lookup",
  "entityCandidates": [],
  "selectedEntity": { "type": "contact", "id": "contact_abc", "label": "John" },
  "memory": [],
  "nextActions": [],
  "citations": []
}
```

Operating model:
- Exact/normalized Firestore entity resolution runs first across organizations, companies, contacts, and aliases.
- Vector retrieval runs only after structured tenant/org filters are applied.
- Memory comes from `agent_memory_chunks`, including compiled Obsidian/Hermes `index`, `wiki`, `raw`, `logs`, and selected operational Firestore data.
- Use vector memory for semantic recall and citations, not as the primary database operation.

Security model:
- VPS Hermes agents (`pip`, `theo`, `maya`, `sage`, `nora`, and specialists) are `role: "ai"` bearer-key callers.
- A Hermes agent lookup must include `requestingUserId` plus valid `agent_memory_delegations` evidence scoped to actor, org, user, status, expiry, and `read`, unless the agent has explicit `agent_memory_system:<orgId>` or `agent_memory_system:*`.
- Delegated lookup runs with the requesting user's effective org permissions.
- Client-effective lookups return only `public` memory chunks by default; internal, restricted, and sensitive chunks are hidden.
- Sensitive mailbox/support/social/ads snippets stay redacted unless source-specific delegated permission is present.
- Direct client Firestore access to `agent_memory_chunks` is denied; all retrieval goes through this API.

#### `POST /admin/agent-memory/reindex` — auth: admin
Manual/admin reindex. Use after new source connectors, schema changes, or backfills.

Body:
```json
{ "orgId": "org_abc", "sourceTypes": ["obsidian", "crm_contact"], "full": false }
```

#### `POST /cron/agent-memory-index`
Incremental scheduled indexing endpoint. Intended for Vercel cron or platform scheduler use, not direct client use.

### Admin agent registry

These are admin UI/VPS orchestration routes, not ordinary client-facing task APIs. They let platform admins inspect and operate named agents. Use them only when Peet asks to manage agents, inspect agent health/logs/files, apply skill policy, or control an agent's cron/config/env.

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/POST | `/admin/agents` | admin; POST super-admin | List or provision named agents. |
| PUT | `/admin/agents/[agentId]` | admin | Update agent metadata/config reference. |
| GET/PUT | `/admin/agents/[agentId]/config` | admin | Read/write live agent config. |
| GET/PATCH | `/admin/agents/[agentId]/env` | admin | Read/update safe env keys. |
| GET | `/admin/agents/[agentId]/health` | admin | Read runtime health. |
| GET | `/admin/agents/[agentId]/logs` | admin | Read recent logs. |
| GET | `/admin/agents/[agentId]/files` | admin | List agent files. |
| GET/PUT | `/admin/agents/[agentId]/files/[...filePath]` | admin | Read/write a file through the agent file proxy. |
| GET/POST | `/admin/agents/[agentId]/cron` | admin | List/create cron jobs. |
| DELETE/POST | `/admin/agents/[agentId]/cron/[jobId]` | admin | Delete or trigger a cron job. |
| GET | `/admin/agents/[agentId]/runs/[runId]` | admin | Inspect a run. |
| GET | `/admin/agents/[agentId]/runs/[runId]/events` | admin | Stream/list run events. |
| POST | `/admin/agents/[agentId]/runs/[runId]/approval` | admin | Approve/reject a gated run action. |
| GET/POST | `/admin/agents/[agentId]/skills` | admin | List/install skills for the agent. |
| DELETE | `/admin/agents/[agentId]/skills/[skillName]` | admin | Remove an installed skill. |
| GET/POST | `/admin/agents/[agentId]/skill-policy` | admin; POST super-admin | Preview/apply the platform skill policy. |
| GET | `/admin/agent-tasks` | admin | List platform-visible agent tasks. |

`POST /admin/agents` provisions through Pip's VPS profile and is super-admin only. `POST /admin/agents/[agentId]/skill-policy` may rewrite live Hermes config, so preview with GET first.

### Hermes profile links and controls

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/PUT/DELETE | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]` | GET client; PUT/DELETE super-admin | Read/configure/disable a Hermes profile link for an org. |
| GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/controls/[control]/[[...path]]` | admin/client with capability | Proxy a resolved Hermes admin control. |
| GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/dashboard/[...path]` | admin/client with capability | Proxy Hermes dashboard paths for the org profile. |
| GET/POST | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/conversations` | admin/client with capability | List/start Hermes conversations. |
| GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/conversations/[convId]` | admin/client with capability | Manage a conversation. |
| GET/POST | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/conversations/[convId]/messages` | admin/client with capability | List/send messages. |
| POST | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/conversations/[convId]/messages/[msgId]/finalize` | admin/client with capability | Finalize a message. |
| GET/POST | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/jobs` | admin/client with capability | List/create jobs. |
| GET/PATCH/PUT/DELETE | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/jobs/[jobId]` | admin/client with capability | Manage a job. |
| POST | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/jobs/[jobId]/run` | admin/client with capability | Run a job now. |
| POST | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/jobs/[jobId]/pause` | admin/client with capability | Pause a job. |
| POST | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/jobs/[jobId]/resume` | admin/client with capability | Resume a job. |
| POST | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/runs` | admin/client with capability | Start a run. |
| GET | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/runs/[runId]` | admin/client with capability | Inspect a run. |
| GET | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/runs/[runId]/events` | admin/client with capability | Stream/list run events. |
| POST | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/runs/[runId]/approval` | admin/client with capability | Approve/reject a gated run action. |
| POST | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/runs/[runId]/stop` | admin/client with capability | Stop a run. |
| GET/POST | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/skills` | admin/client with capability | List/install profile skills. |
| DELETE | `/admin/hermes/profiles/[orgId]/skills/[skillName]` | admin/client with capability | Remove a profile skill. |

Hermes controls go through `requireHermesProfileAccess` and `resolveHermesAdminControl`; do not construct arbitrary VPS URLs from the client side. The API capability gate is the source of truth.

### Loop Engine self-improvement and business insight review

Use this section when Peet asks whether the agents are self-improving, whether the system is being proactive, or whether business insight gaps are being surfaced.

The active review loops are:

- `agent-evolution-review` — turns repeated agent blockers, rework, stale instructions, and review failures into evidence-backed learning proposals.
- `business-insight-review` — turns commercial, operational, and data-quality signals into internal insight cards/tasks before Peet has to inspect every workstream manually.

Loop Engine routes:

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/admin/loop-engine/evaluate` | admin/ai | Evaluate a loop manually. Use dry-run first; set `persist` and `persistReviewTasks` only when review task creation is intended. |
| GET | `/admin/loop-engine/runs` | admin/ai | List recent org-scoped `loop_engine_runs`; use these records as evidence for candidates, actions, telemetry, and skipped reasons. |
| POST | `/projects/[projectId]/tasks/[taskId]/business-insight-action` | client/admin/ai with project access | Convert an approved `business-insight-review` task into tracked internal action work. |
| GET | `/api/cron/loop-review` | cron/admin | Scheduled loop-review worker; persists `loop_engine_runs` and conservative review task drafts. |

Business insight signal sources include CRM contacts/deals, capture sources, SEO sprints, ad campaigns, social posts/inbox, invoices, support tickets, reports, projects, agent outputs, previous `loop_engine_runs`, and client document review state.

Client document business metrics are:

- `client_documents_waiting_for_review` — `client_review` documents older than 7 days.
- `client_documents_changes_requested` — documents currently in `changes_requested`.
- `client_documents_blocking_publish_assumptions` — documents with open `blocks_publish` assumptions.

Guardrails:

- These loops may read, draft, create internal tasks, and report. They must not automatically rewrite skills/wiki/prompts/runtime config, message clients, publish content, change spend, approve finance, or change client-visible document access.
- Preserve approval gates from the loop registry: `human-review`, `client-visible`, `public-publishing`, `paid-spend`, and `finance`.
- Exact agent model/token/cost/duration evidence must come from existing task/run telemetry. Never estimate token/cost numbers; when telemetry is absent, record a tooling-gap instead of inventing data.
- Agent learning proposals need source task/run ids, repeated pattern counts, reviewer context, proposed instruction change, and validation plan before any skill or wiki update.
- Business insight proposals need source item ids, metric snapshot, opportunity/risk hypothesis, owner, recommended next action, and approval requirement.

### Hermes runtime and provider health

Treat these as separate acceptance gates:

1. `systemctl is-active hermes@<profile>` proves only that the gateway process is alive.
2. `/profiles/<profile>/health` proves only that the profile API is serving.
3. A real authenticated `POST /profiles/<profile>/v1/responses` with the prompt `Reply with exactly CODEXOK and nothing else.` proves the configured model provider can answer.

For a VPS provider incident, run the model canary across every routed active profile (`ads`, `data`, `docs`, `maya`, `nora`, `pip`, `qa-release`, `sage`, `sales`, `seo`, `support`, `theo`) before claiming the scope. The `default` unit is intentionally API-less and is verified through systemd stability and clean logs.

Keep platform API authentication separate from model-provider authentication:

- Test PiB credentials against an authoritative PiB endpoint, including `X-Org-Id` where required.
- `401 token_invalidated`, `token_revoked`, or `token_expired` from `openai-codex` is a Hermes provider credential failure, not a PiB API-key failure.
- A healthy profile endpoint plus a failed `CODEXOK` response is still an outage.
- A fallback that returns billing/credit, organisation-policy, or missing-provider errors is not a successful fallback.

For one failing Codex profile, use a profile-specific device flow; do not copy another working profile's `auth.json` or refresh token:

```bash
sudo -iu hermes bash -lc 'export HERMES_HOME=/var/lib/hermes; cd /var/lib/hermes/hermes-agent; /usr/local/bin/hermes -p <profile> auth add openai-codex --type oauth --no-browser --timeout 600'
```

After successful sign-in:

1. Restart only `hermes@<profile>`.
2. Wait at least 30 seconds and require `NRestarts` not to increase.
3. Require the public profile health route to return HTTP 200.
4. Require the real model canary to return exact `CODEXOK`.
5. Requeue blocked agent work only after all four checks pass.

Never print API keys, OAuth access tokens, refresh tokens, or raw profile environment values during this workflow.

### Linked computers — adopt legacy project locations (system path)

Use when Messages shows **Legacy · pairing required**, Sync now is disabled, or project chats have **No ready project computers**.

Wiki: `agents/partners/wiki/system-legacy-location-adoption-2026-07-22.md`

#### Adopt onto an already-paired device

```bash
POST /linked-computers/:deviceId/adopt-location
Authorization: Bearer $AI_API_KEY
{
  "adoptLocationId": "peets-mac-mini",   # or partners-vps
  "actorUserId": "zcpAJ4NXWQfjXWPXkl6nYwt7Gmm1"
}
```

Or from the repo with Firebase admin:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/list-linked-adoption-targets.ts
npx tsx scripts/adopt-project-location-onto-device.ts --dry-run \
  --device-id <id> --location-id peets-mac-mini
npx tsx scripts/adopt-project-location-onto-device.ts --apply \
  --device-id <id> --location-id partners-vps
```

#### Fresh VPS/Mac with no linked device yet

1. `POST /linked-computers/pairing` with `deviceKind`, `ownerType`, `adoptLocationId`
2. On the machine: `pib-runtime pair --challenge <id> --platform linux|macos`
3. Confirm workspace map if mapping status is pending

Do **not** tell the user to wait on Sync now while any linked location is still legacy. Sync also needs `PROJECT_SYNC_STORAGE_LIFECYCLE_VERIFIED` after TTL/lifecycle readback — separate from project chat readiness.

## Error reference

| HTTP | Error | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| 401 | Unauthorized | Check `AI_API_KEY` or key expiry |
| 403 | Forbidden | Key lacks org access, or caller isn't super-admin for a super-admin-only route |
| 404 | `Agent not found` / `Profile not found` | Verify `agentId`/`orgId` |
| 429 | Rate limited | Respect `Retry-After` header |

## Agent patterns

1. **Dry-run before persisting.** For skill-policy apply and Loop Engine evaluate, GET/dry-run first, then apply/persist only when intended.
2. **Never claim provider health from one signal alone.** Require systemd + profile health + model canary all passing before declaring an incident resolved.
3. **Read-back after config/env writes.** Confirm the agent config or env change actually landed before reporting success.
4. **Preserve Loop Engine approval gates** — these loops draft and report; they never auto-publish, spend, or message clients.
5. **Never print secrets** during profile auth recovery workflows.
