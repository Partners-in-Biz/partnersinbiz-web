# Platform Ops — Partners in Biz Platform API

Cross-cutting platform operations, plus the canonical reference for the collaboration primitives every other skill uses.

## Related skills

This mega-skill was split. If the request is about one of these, use that skill instead:

- `agent-runtime-ops` — Hermes profile links/controls, agent registry/admin, agent memory lookup/reindex, Loop Engine internals, runtime/provider health, linked computers
- `platform-admin-users` — Platform Users (staff) super-admin CRUD, onboard/offboard
- `reports` — snapshot reports + ad-hoc query reports (revenue, pipeline, outstanding, client-value, expense-summary, activity-summary, team-utilization)
- `billing-finance` — FX rates now live there (short reference + auth pointer)
- `book-studio-ops` — Book Studio production engine + Creative Canvas bridge
- `youtube-studio-ops` — YouTube Studio pipeline + Creative Canvas bridge
- `creative-canvas-ops` — canvas node graphs/runs/exports + BYOK provider connections
- `system-auth` — auth/delegation mint & resolve rules

## Auth (mandatory)

Interactive Hermes runs use the **user-delegation** token injected by Messages / minted via `system-auth` (`Authorization: Bearer pib_dlg_…` + `X-Org-Id`).

- Prefer the injected delegation token for all `/api/v1/*` calls in a human-triggered run.
- `AI_API_KEY` / agent system keys are **cron/system only**.
- Never claim a write succeeded without read-back (see pack `verificationContract` / skill success gate).
- See skill `system-auth` for mint/resolve rules.


## Base URL & Authentication

```
https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1
```

```
Authorization: Bearer <AI_API_KEY>
```

Prefer the user-delegation Bearer token (`pib_dlg_…`) for interactive/human-triggered runs, or per-agent `pib_ag_...` keys from Firestore `api_keys` for VPS Hermes profiles. The legacy shared `AI_API_KEY` is a cron/system-only fallback, not the desired credential model for interactive work.

For AI/agent bearer requests to tenant-scoped routes, also send:

```
X-Org-Id: <orgId>
```

Some routes have stricter delegation rules than ordinary admin-style agent access. Agent memory and mailbox operations must prove the requesting user context unless the agent has an explicit system permission.

### Browser auth and guest session routes

These routes are for browser sign-in/session cookies, not agent bearer automation:

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/magic-link/send` | public, rate-limited | Sends a single-use magic link. Body: `{ email, redirectUrl?, context?, docTitle? }`. Always returns `{ sent: true }` when accepted so account existence is not leaked. |
| GET | `/auth/magic-link/verify` | public token link | Consumes the magic-link token, creates/finds the guest user, mints a Firebase custom token, and redirects to `/auth/magic-link/verify`. |
| POST | `/auth/session` | public with Firebase ID token | Exchanges an ID token for the `__session` cookie and bootstraps `users/{uid}`. |
| POST/DELETE | `/api/auth/session` | public with Firebase ID token or cookie | Legacy browser session create/delete route. |
| GET/POST | `/api/auth/verify` | browser cookie/session-cookie helper | Verifies session and returns uid, role, email/name, and super-admin state. |
| GET/POST | `/api/auth/logout` | browser | Clears the session cookie and redirects to `/`. |

Do not use these for server-to-server agent calls. Agent work should use API keys, platform sessions, or delegated user evidence depending on the route.

## Collaboration primitives (canonical reference)

Every resource across all skills follows these primitives:

### Actor tagging

Every create/update records:
```json
{ "createdBy": "uid_or_agent_id", "createdByType": "user" | "agent" | "system",
  "updatedBy": "...", "updatedByType": "...", "updatedAt": "..." }
```

Agents and humans leave symmetric audit trails. `system` is reserved for cron-originated writes.

### Idempotency keys

Pass `Idempotency-Key: <uuid>` header on any `POST` that creates billable/notifiable resources. Same key replays the cached response for 24h.

Required for: `POST /invoices`, `POST /expenses`, `POST /quotes`, `POST /email/send`, `POST /tasks`, `POST /time-entries`, `POST /calendar/events`, `POST /forms`, `POST /organizations`, `POST /webhooks`.

Optional (but supported) everywhere else.

### Unified comments

Leave notes on any resource. Supported `resourceType`:
- `invoice`, `quote`, `contact`, `deal`, `project`, `task`
- `expense`, `time_entry`, `form_submission`, `calendar_event`, `client_org`

```json
POST /comments
{ "orgId": "org_abc", "resourceType": "invoice", "resourceId": "inv_xyz",
  "body": "Client wants to extend due date. @user:uid123 please review.",
  "parentCommentId": null, "attachments": ["file_abc"] }
```

`@user:<uid>` and `@agent:<id>` in body auto-create mention notifications. A denormalised `mentionIds: string[]` field on each comment enables fast inbox lookups.

### Unified workspace inbox

**Not the same as `/api/v1/social/inbox`** (which is social engagement).

The workspace inbox aggregates everything needing attention — notifications, mentions, assignments, pending approvals, overdue invoices — in one endpoint.

### Assignments

`assignedTo: { type: 'user' | 'agent', id }` works on tasks and calendar events. Creates a notification on assignment.

### Notifications

First-class notification feed. Types include: `task.assigned`, `invoice.paid`, `invoice.overdue`, `mention`, `form.submitted`, `expense.submitted`, `expense.approved`, `expense.rejected`, `member.invited`, `brand.updated`, `contact.created`, `deal.stage_changed`.

## API Reference

### Platform API keys

#### `GET /platform/api-keys` — auth: admin
List keys (hashes not returned; only `keyPrefix`).

#### `POST /platform/api-keys` — auth: admin
Body:
```json
{ "name": "Hermes production agent", "role": "agent", "orgId": "org_abc",
  "expiresAt": "2027-01-01" }
```

`role`: `admin` (prefix `pib_ak_`) or `agent` (prefix `pib_ag_`). Returns the raw key **once** in `keyOnce` — store it immediately. Subsequent GETs only show `keyPrefix`.

Response (201): `{ id, keyOnce, keyPrefix }`.

#### `GET/PUT/DELETE /platform/api-keys/[id]` — auth: admin
`DELETE` revokes.

### Global search

#### `GET /search?q=...` — auth: admin
Query: `q` (min 2 chars), `limit` (default 5, max 20).

Searches across: `contacts`, `projects`, `tasks`, `invoices`.

Response:
```json
[ { "id": "...", "type": "contact" | "project" | "task" | "invoice",
    "title": "...", "subtitle": "...", "url": "/admin/..." } ]
```

### Dashboard

#### `GET /dashboard/stats` — auth: admin
Top-line metrics:
```json
{ "contacts": { "total": 142 },
  "deals": { "total": 23, "pipelineValue": 120000, "wonValue": 45000 },
  "email": { "sent": 312, "opened": 180 },
  "sequences": { "active": 4, "activeEnrollments": 67 } }
```

#### `GET /dashboard/email-stats` — auth: admin
Email-specific metrics: sent, delivered, opened, clicked, bounced over last 30 days.

#### `GET /dashboard/activity` — auth: admin
Recent activity feed for dashboard widgets.

### Activity feed

#### `GET /activity` — auth: admin
Full activity feed (audit log). Filters: `orgId`, `type`, `resourceType`, `resourceId`, `from`, `to`, `page`, `limit`.

### Briefings

Briefings aggregate current account/project/CRM/document/social/support signals into a scannable action feed. Use these when the user asks what needs attention, asks for an account pulse, or wants to mark/read/defer briefing cards.

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/briefings/feed` | client | Build the current briefing feed for the authenticated user's active scope. |
| POST | `/briefings/items/[itemId]/state` | client | Save per-user state for a briefing item (read/dismissed/snoozed/etc., based on route body). |
| POST | `/briefings/reports` | client | Create a durable briefing snapshot/report. |

Recent guardrail: urgent `task.agent_done` notification cards can be review work even when the task is already done. Inspect the source task state before calling something blocked; for project tasks, `columnId=done`, `agentStatus=done`, and `reviewStatus=approved` means the action is review/open-source, not unblock.

### Platform utility and cron routes

These routes are cross-cutting infrastructure. Use them for platform health, setup, session-safe public metadata, push-token registration, and scheduled workers.

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/firebase-config` | public/client | Browser Firebase config bootstrap. |
| GET | `/org-dashboard` | client | Organization dashboard summary. |
| GET/PUT | `/settings/domain` | admin | Domain-related platform settings. |
| GET/PATCH | `/settings/features` | admin | Feature flags/settings. |
| GET/PATCH | `/settings/integrations` | admin | Integration settings. |
| POST | `/push-tokens` | client | Register mobile/web push token. |
| DELETE | `/push-tokens/[token]` | client | Remove a push token. |
| GET/PUT | `/orgs/[orgId]/chat-config` | admin/client with org access | Configure visible agents/chat behavior for an org. |
| GET | `/orgs/[orgId]/contacts` | client | Org-scoped contact lookup helper. |
| GET | `/orgs/[orgId]/visible-agents` | client | Visible agents for chat/portal context. |
| GET | `/llms.txt` | public | Public AI crawler/discovery metadata. |
| GET | `/llms-full.txt` | public | Expanded public AI crawler/discovery metadata. |

Current cron routes:

| Method | Path | Use |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/cron/agent-memory-index` | Incremental agent memory indexing (see `agent-runtime-ops`). |
| GET | `/api/cron/anomalies` | Scheduled anomaly checks. |
| GET | `/api/cron/conversation-runs` | Unified chat/Hermes run finalization. |
| GET | `/api/cron/crm-integrations` | CRM integration syncs. |
| GET | `/api/cron/integrations` | Generic property/integration dispatch. |
| GET | `/api/cron/loop-review` | Scheduled agent-evolution and business-insight review loop (see `agent-runtime-ops`). |
| GET | `/api/cron/project-playbooks` | Scheduled project playbook jobs. |
| GET | `/api/cron/reports` | Scheduled report generation/sending (see `reports`). |
| GET | `/api/cron/seo-daily` | SEO daily loop. |
| GET | `/api/cron/seo-weekly` | SEO weekly optimization loop. |
| GET | `/api/cron/social-analytics` | Social analytics pull. |
| GET | `/api/cron/social-inbox-poll` | Social inbox polling. |
| GET | `/api/cron/social-rss` | RSS social auto-posting. |
| GET | `/api/cron/webhooks` | Outbound webhook queue processing. |

### Ads activity types (Phase 7)

Ad lifecycle events emit to the same `activity` collection with these types:

- `ad_campaign.{created|launched|paused|edited|deleted}`
- `ad_set.{created|launched|paused|edited|deleted}`
- `ad.{created|launched|paused|edited|deleted}`
- `ad_creative.{uploaded|archived|synced}`
- `ad_custom_audience.{created|list_uploaded|deleted}`

Each entry has `entityId` + `entityType` + `entityTitle` for cross-linking to the relevant ads admin page.

### Files

#### `POST /upload` — auth: admin
**multipart/form-data** with fields:
- `file` (required)
- `folder` (default `uploads`)
- `orgId`
- `relatedToType` + `relatedToId` (for linking)

Saves to Firebase Storage + writes metadata doc to `uploads` collection.

Response: `{ id, url, name, mimeType, size }`.

#### `GET /files` — auth: admin
List uploaded files. Filters: `orgId` (required), `type` (mime prefix, e.g. `image/`), `search` (filename contains), `relatedToType`, `relatedToId`, `page`, `limit`.

#### `GET /files/[id]` — auth: admin
Metadata including `url`, `mimeType`, `size`, `relatedTo`.

#### `DELETE /files/[id]` — auth: admin
Soft-delete (metadata). `?force=true` hard-deletes the Firestore doc (storage blob is NOT deleted — delete manually if needed).

### Workspace folders and Drive sync policy

For client/workspace assets, prefer the workspace folder registry over ad-hoc uploaded-file paths. A workspace or resource can have many linked folders, each with its own hierarchy, tags, sort order, Drive folder id/url, VPS/local sync targets, visibility, sync mode/state, and conflict/audit status.

V1 operating rules:
- Google Drive is canonical for binary/source assets.
- Obsidian/wiki remains markdown and lightweight text knowledge only; do not put PDFs, video, images, design exports, or other binaries in the vault.
- Folder visibility is per folder: `admin_only`, `admin_agents`, or `admin_agents_clients`.
- PiB roles/visibility decide what the app and agents can read; Drive ACLs must not accidentally expose admin/agent-only folders to clients.
- Sync targets can include both VPS and Peet's local Cowork environment; full file sync is expected for linked asset folders, not metadata-only sync.
- Conflicts must be preserved and audited. Do not use blind last-writer-wins.

Runbook: `docs/deploy/workspace-folder-sync-v1.md`.

#### Workspace OS API surface

Current route inventory from `partnersinbiz-web@origin/development`:

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/POST | `/workspace-folders` | client | List or create linked workspace folders for an org/resource. |
| GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/workspace-folders/[id]` | client | Read, update, or disconnect a linked folder. |
| POST | `/workspace-folders/[id]/resync` | client | Request a resync for a linked folder. |
| GET | `/workspace-artifacts` | client | List artifacts the caller can read. |
| GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/workspace-artifacts/[id]` | client | Read, update, or request deletion/removal for an artifact record. |
| POST | `/workspace-artifacts/link-existing` | client | Register an existing Drive/file artifact against the workspace. |
| GET/POST | `/workspace-connections` | client | List or create connected external workspace accounts. |
| GET/PATCH/DELETE | `/workspace-connections/[id]` | client | Manage connected external workspace accounts. |
| POST | `/workspace-connections/[id]/reconnect` | client | Restart a broken connection flow. |
| POST | `/workspace-connections/[id]/review` | client | Record review/approval of a connection. |
| GET | `/agent/workspace-folders` | admin/agent | Agent lookup for readable workspace folders by org/resource/tag. |
| GET | `/agent/workspace-artifacts` | client/agent | Agent lookup for readable artifacts by org/resource/project/task/folder/type/status/q. |

Workspace artifacts are capability-scoped. `canReadWorkspaceArtifact` gates reads by org membership, role, visibility, and linked folder/resource policy. Do not bypass these APIs with raw Drive URLs unless Peet explicitly gives a direct file link.

#### Knowledge note proxy

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/POST | `/admin/knowledge` | admin | Read or save markdown notes through Pip's knowledge backend. Supports `scope: shared|agent`, `section: index|wiki|raw|logs`, `agent`, `path`, and `content` for writes. |

Use this route for platform-mediated Obsidian/wiki persistence. For client-agent knowledge, pass the client knowledge agent/domain as `agent`; the route resolves aliases and rejects unsafe names.

#### Workspace Broker API surface

Use Workspace Broker when the agent needs the platform to create/copy/export Google workspace assets on behalf of the authenticated user/org.

For direct service-account Drive/Docs/Sheets work, use the `google-workspace` skill and the
`/google/drive/*`, `/google/docs/create`, and `/google/sheets/*` proxy endpoints. Use Workspace
Broker when you need a durable broker job, approval/review trail, or workspace artifact record;
use the direct Google proxy for straightforward list/upload/download/share/search/doc/sheet calls
that already have the required PiB auth and org scope.

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/workspace-broker/docs/create` | admin | Create a Google Doc and record a broker job. |
| POST | `/workspace-broker/docs/copy-template` | admin | Copy a Google Doc template. |
| POST | `/workspace-broker/sheets/create` | admin | Create a Google Sheet and record a broker job. |
| POST | `/workspace-broker/sheets/copy-template` | admin | Copy a Google Sheet template. |
| POST | `/workspace-broker/folders/create` | admin | Create a Google Drive folder. |
| POST | `/workspace-broker/artifacts/[id]/export` | admin | Export an artifact. |
| POST | `/workspace-broker/artifacts/[id]/permission-audit` | admin | Audit artifact sharing/ACL state. |
| POST | `/workspace-broker/artifacts/[id]/request-share` | admin | Request or apply sharing changes. |
| POST | `/workspace-broker/artifacts/[id]/request-delete` | admin | Request deletion/removal through the broker. |
| GET | `/workspace-broker/jobs` | admin | List broker jobs. |
| GET/PATCH | `/workspace-broker/jobs/[id]` | admin | Read or update a broker job. |

Broker routes create durable `workspace-broker` jobs. After a broker call, poll `/workspace-broker/jobs/[id]` instead of assuming synchronous completion.

### Health

#### `GET /health` — auth: admin
```json
{ "ok": true, "timestamp": "...", "services": { "firestore": "ok", "auth": "ok", "storage": "ok" } }
```

For Hermes/model-provider runtime health (systemd, profile health, model canary), see `agent-runtime-ops`.

### Workspace inbox

#### `GET /inbox` — auth: admin
Unified inbox aggregating:
- `notification` items (from `notifications`)
- `mention` items (from `comments` where `mentionIds` contains current user/agent)
- `assignment` items (tasks assigned to current user/agent, status `todo`|`in_progress`)
- `approval` items (expenses `status=submitted`, social posts `status=pending_approval`)
- `overdue_invoice` items (invoices `status=overdue`)

Query: `orgId` (required), `for` (`me`|`agent`|`all`, default `me`), `unread` (default `true`), `limit` (default 50, max 200), `cursor` (ISO timestamp for keyset pagination).

Response:
```json
{ "items": [
    { "id": "inbox_X", "itemType": "mention", "resourceType": "invoice", "resourceId": "inv_xyz",
      "title": "Pip mentioned you", "body": "Client wants to extend due date...",
      "priority": "normal", "link": "/portal/invoicing/inv_xyz", "createdAt": "..." }
  ],
  "nextCursor": "2026-04-15T09:00:00Z" }
```

#### `POST /inbox/read` — auth: admin
Body: `{ itemIds: string[] }`. Marks notification items read. Non-notification items are marked read by interacting with their resource.

Response: `{ marked: count }`.

#### `POST /inbox/snooze` — auth: admin
Body: `{ itemId, until: ISO }`. Only for notifications.

### Notifications

#### `GET /notifications` — auth: admin
Filters: `orgId` (required), `status` (default `unread`), `userId`, `agentId`, `type`, `limit`, `cursor`.

Item shape:
```json
{ "id": "...", "orgId": "...", "userId": "uid_or_null", "agentId": "aid_or_null",
  "type": "task.assigned", "title": "...", "body": "...", "link": "/admin/tasks/...",
  "data": {...}, "priority": "normal", "status": "unread",
  "snoozedUntil": null, "readAt": null, "createdAt": "..." }
```

#### `POST /notifications` — auth: admin
Body: notification fields. Required: `orgId`, `type`, `title`. At least one of `userId`/`agentId` (or both null for org-wide).

#### `GET/PATCH/DELETE /notifications/[id]` — auth: admin
PATCH updatable: `status`, `snoozedUntil`, `priority`. `status='read'` sets `readAt`.

#### `POST /notifications/read-all` — auth: admin
Body: `{ userId?, agentId?, orgId }`. Marks all unread for that recipient read.

### Outbound webhooks (durable queue)

#### Architecture overview

```
your-api-call → dispatchWebhook() → writes to webhook_queue
                                          │
                                   (every 1 min Vercel cron)
                                          ↓
                                   processPendingWebhooks()
                                          │
                                   POSTs to webhook.url with HMAC signature
                                          │
                                   on success → webhook_deliveries (audit)
                                   on failure → retry with backoff [0s, 30s, 2m, 10m, 1h, 6h]
                                                 max 6 attempts; auto-disable after 10 failures
```

#### `GET /webhooks` — auth: admin
Filters: `orgId` (required), `active`, pagination. Secret is redacted as `***`.

#### `POST /webhooks` — auth: admin (idempotent)
Body:
```json
{
  "orgId": "org_abc",
  "name": "Slack notifier",
  "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/...",
  "events": ["invoice.paid", "deal.won", "form.submitted"],
  "secret": "<optional — auto-generated if omitted>"
}
```

URL must be `https://` in production (dev can allow http via env). Events must be from the allowed list (see below).

Response (201): `{ id, secretOnce, secret: '***' }`. **`secretOnce` is only returned on create** — store it immediately.

#### `GET/PUT/DELETE /webhooks/[id]` — auth: admin
PUT updatable: `name`, `url`, `events`, `active`. See `/rotate-secret` for secret rotation.
DELETE soft-deletes.

#### `POST /webhooks/[id]/rotate-secret` — auth: admin
Rotates the HMAC secret. Returns the new secret once in `secretOnce` — store it immediately. All future deliveries sign with the new secret, so update consumer verification code **before** rotating.

Response (201): `{ id, secretOnce: "new_secret_hex", secret: "***" }`.

#### `POST /webhooks/[id]/test` — auth: admin
Queues a test event bypassing subscription filter. Returns `{ queued: true, queueItemId }`.

#### `POST /webhooks/[id]/enable` / `POST /webhooks/[id]/disable` — auth: admin
Manual enable/disable. Enable clears `autoDisabledAt` + `failureCount`.

#### `GET /webhooks/[id]/deliveries` — auth: admin
Query: `limit` (default 20, max 100), `cursor` (doc id). Sorted `deliveredAt desc`.

Delivery shape:
```json
{ "id": "dl_abc", "webhookId": "wh_xyz", "queueItemId": "wq_abc", "event": "invoice.paid",
  "payloadHash": "sha256...", "responseStatus": 200, "responseHeaders": {...},
  "responseBody": "ok (truncated 2KB)", "durationMs": 142, "attemptNumber": 1,
  "deliveredAt": "...", "error": null }
```

#### `POST /webhooks/[id]/deliveries/[deliveryId]/replay` — auth: admin
Re-queues a fresh `webhook_queue` item copying the original event + payload. Original record untouched.

#### `GET /webhooks/queue-stats` — auth: admin
Global observability snapshot. Optional `?orgId=X` scope. Returns:
```json
{ "byStatus": { "pending": N, "delivering": N, "failed": N, "deliveredLast24h": N },
  "oldestPendingAgeSeconds": N | null,
  "stuckDeliveringCount": N,
  "webhooks": { "total": N, "active": N, "autoDisabled": N },
  "timestamp": "ISO" }
```

`stuckDeliveringCount` = items claimed more than 5 minutes ago and still in `delivering`. Non-zero means a worker died mid-flight — investigate.

#### `GET /webhooks/[id]/queue` — auth: admin
Queue items for a specific webhook (debug view).

Query: `status` (pending|delivering|delivered|failed), `limit` (default 20, max 100), `cursor` (doc id from previous page).

Response: `{ items: [...], nextCursor: string | null }`.

#### Webhook event reference

| Event | Payload fields |
|-------|----------------|
| `invoice.created` | `id, invoiceNumber, total, currency, clientOrgId, dueDate` |
| `invoice.sent` | `id, invoiceNumber, total, currency, clientEmail, dueDate, publicViewUrl` |
| `invoice.paid` | `id, invoiceNumber, total, paymentMethod, paymentReference, paidAmount` |
| `invoice.overdue` | `id, invoiceNumber, total, dueDate, daysOverdue` |
| `quote.created` | `id, quoteNumber, total, currency, clientOrgId` |
| `quote.accepted` / `quote.rejected` | `id, quoteNumber, clientOrgId` |
| `contact.created` / `contact.updated` | `id, name, email, company, source` (orgId in metadata) |
| `deal.created` | `id, title, value, stage, contactId` |
| `deal.stage_changed` | `id, fromStage, toStage, value` |
| `deal.won` / `deal.lost` | `id, value, contactId` |
| `form.submitted` | `formId, slug, submissionId, contactId, data` |
| `payment.received` | `invoiceId, invoiceNumber, amount, paymentMethod, reference` |
| `expense.submitted` | `id, amount, currency, category, userId, submittedBy` |
| `task.completed` | `id, title, projectId, completedBy` |

#### Webhook signature verification (consumer code)

Every request includes:
- `X-PIB-Event` — event name
- `X-PIB-Delivery-Id` — unique delivery id
- `X-PIB-Timestamp` — ms since epoch
- `X-PIB-Signature` — `sha256=<hex>` HMAC of `${timestamp}.${rawBody}` using webhook secret

Node verifier:
```js
import crypto from 'crypto'

function verifyWebhook(req, rawBody, secret) {
  const timestamp = req.headers['x-pib-timestamp']
  const signature = req.headers['x-pib-signature']
  if (!timestamp || !signature) return false

  // Reject if timestamp is more than 5 min old (replay protection)
  if (Math.abs(Date.now() - Number(timestamp)) > 5 * 60 * 1000) return false

  const expected = 'sha256=' + crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(`${timestamp}.${rawBody}`)
    .digest('hex')

  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(signature), Buffer.from(expected))
}
```

### Agent manifest

#### `GET /agent` — auth: admin
Returns a manifest of agent-accessible endpoints with examples. Use this to discover capabilities programmatically.

#### `GET /agent/inbox` — auth: admin
Legacy agent-specific inbox — superseded by `/inbox` for new work.

#### Agent email work queue

Current route inventory:

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/agent/email` | client/agent | Agent email capability overview. |
| GET | `/agent/email/accounts` | client/agent | List connected Gmail/SMTP accounts for a user (no secrets). |
| GET | `/agent/email/messages` | client/agent | List delegated messages available to the agent. |
| POST | `/agent/email/drafts` | client/agent | Draft outbound email for human review; returns `contextRef` + `open_context` uiActions. |
| POST | `/agent/email/replies` | client/agent | Prepare a reply draft for human review; returns `contextRef` + `open_context` uiActions. |
| POST | `/agent/email/send-requests` | client/agent | Create an auditable send request. |

Mailbox/email operations are stricter than ordinary admin-like agent access. The route must prove the requesting user/delegation context unless the agent has explicit system permission.

### Workspace mailbox operations

Mailbox routes manage connected Gmail/Google mailbox accounts and messages. Use `email-outreach` for marketing sends, sequences, broadcasts, templates, and analytics. Use this section for operational inbox work, delegated mailbox triage, account sync, and support replies.

#### Admin mailbox

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/POST | `/admin/mailbox/accounts` | admin | List/connect admin mailbox accounts. |
| DELETE/PATCH | `/admin/mailbox/accounts/[id]` | admin | Disconnect/update a mailbox account. |
| POST | `/admin/mailbox/accounts/[id]/sync` | admin | Trigger account sync. |
| GET | `/admin/mailbox/google/authorize` | admin | Start Google OAuth authorization. |
| GET | `/admin/mailbox/google/callback` | admin | Google OAuth callback. |
| GET/POST | `/admin/mailbox/messages` | admin | List/send admin mailbox messages. |
| DELETE/PATCH | `/admin/mailbox/messages/[id]` | admin | Delete/update a mailbox message. |

#### Portal mailbox

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/POST | `/portal/email/accounts` | client | List/connect portal mailbox accounts. |
| DELETE/PATCH | `/portal/email/accounts/[id]` | client | Disconnect/update a portal mailbox account. |
| POST | `/portal/email/accounts/[id]/sync` | client | Trigger portal account sync. |
| GET | `/portal/email/google/authorize` | client | Start Google OAuth authorization. |
| GET | `/portal/email/google/callback` | client | Google OAuth callback. |
| GET/POST | `/portal/email/messages` | client | List/send portal mailbox messages. |
| DELETE/PATCH | `/portal/email/messages/[id]` | client | Delete/update a portal mailbox message. |

Agents should not treat mailbox messages as marketing broadcasts. Respect delegated user context and keep outbound replies auditable via `/agent/email/*` or the mailbox message routes, depending on the requested workflow.

#### Connected mailbox first (operational Gmail / SMTP)

Messages always injects a `[Mailbox connections]` block for interactive runs (connected or `status: none`).

1. If the prompt says `status: connected`, call `GET /agent/email/accounts` then `GET /agent/email/messages?summarize=true&q=...` with the injected `pib_dlg_…` Bearer token **before** asking the user to paste email content.
2. Never claim you cannot access their email when the mailbox block shows a connected account — use `/agent/email/*`.
3. Portal `/portal/email/*` is browser/session only. Hermes must use `/agent/email/*`.
4. Message reads auto-refresh stale Google sync (≈5 min) and, when `q` is set, also run a **live Gmail search** that imports matches before filtering. Prefer short queries (`rs@ahslaw.co.za`, `Rikus Stander July 20`) — not full Gmail UI sentences.
5. `summarize=true` returns `bodyPreview` (up to 8k). For full text use `GET /agent/email/messages/{id}`. If connected + hits exist, **never** ask the user to paste the email.
6. **Compose / “put this in an email” (mandatory):** `POST /agent/email/drafts` with `to`, `subject`, `bodyText`, plus `conversationId` + `responseMessageId` from the mailbox block when present. Echo returned `uiActions`/`contextRef` (`open_context`) so Messages opens the email side canvas. **Never** paste a full email as chat-only preview. Drafts work even when mailbox status is `none` (send disabled until connect). Humans **Approve & send**; do not auto-send.
7. **Peet mailbox draft style (mandatory for peet.stander@partnersinbiz.online):**
   - **No manual signature footer:** never append `Peet Stander`, `Partners in Biz`, `Cheers,\nPeet`, or similar name/company closings. His connected mailbox already applies his email signature. End the body after the last content paragraph (optional short sign-off word like `Thanks,` is OK only if he asked; default is none).

### Admin operations utility routes

For the Hermes agent registry, admin agent config/health/logs/skills/cron, and Hermes profile links/controls, see `agent-runtime-ops`. For Platform Users (staff) CRUD and password/reset routes, see `platform-admin-users`.

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/admin/notification-preferences` | admin | Read/update admin notification preferences (GET/PATCH). |
| GET | `/admin/support` | admin | List support tickets. |
| PATCH | `/admin/support/[id]` | admin | Update support ticket status/metadata. |
| GET/POST | `/admin/support/[id]/messages` | admin | List/add support ticket messages. |

### Unified chat conversations

These routes back the in-app admin/client/agent chat surface. They are distinct from `/communications/*`, which is the customer-channel inbox for WhatsApp/SMS/email/in-app/social DMs.

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET/POST | `/conversations` | client | List or create a unified chat conversation for an org. `POST` requires `orgId` and `participants`. Valid scopes: `general`, `project`, `task`, `campaign`. |
| GET/PATCH | `/conversations/[convId]` | participant or admin/ai | Fetch conversation or update `title`/`archived`. |
| DELETE | `/conversations/[convId]` | admin | Permanently delete a conversation. |
| GET/POST | `/conversations/[convId]/messages` | participant or admin/ai | List messages or add a user message/attachments/slash command; agent participants dispatch Hermes runs. |
| POST | `/conversations/[convId]/attachments` | participant or admin/ai | Upload an attachment up to 10MB. Allowed: common image types, PDF, text/markdown/csv/json, docx, xlsx. |
| PATCH | `/conversations/[convId]/context` | participant or admin/ai | Add/remove/clear structured context references. Body action is `add`, `remove`, or `clear`. |
| POST | `/conversations/[convId]/messages/[msgId]/finalize` | participant or admin/ai | Poll Hermes and write a run result back into the pending assistant message. Requires `runId` and `agentId`. |
| POST | `/conversations/[convId]/messages/[msgId]/stop` | admin | Stop an in-flight agent run through the agent gateway and mark the message failed. |
| POST | `/admin/agents/[agentId]/runs/[runId]/actions` | admin | Send a rich-message action back to a Hermes run. Approval/denial reuses the run approval endpoint; clarify/model-picker/choose/retry/open/copy/download/custom actions are proxied to the run actions endpoint. |

Conversation participant rules:
- Client callers may start conversations only with people in their org or platform admins.
- Admin/AI callers may include visible agents. When multiple agents are selected, Pip is inserted as orchestrator when available.
- Client org context and attached context refs are injected into the Hermes prompt. Do not manually paste unrelated client context into a conversation.

Rich chat output contract:
- Hermes events and final run payloads may include `richParts`/`rich_parts` and `uiActions`/`ui_actions`. The PiB chat normalizer and finalizer preserve those fields instead of flattening them into text.
- Supported `richParts` include `markdown`, `code`, `table`, `image`, `gallery`, `file`, `audio`, `video`, `tool_output`, `status`, `approval`, `clarify`, and `model_picker`.
- Supported `uiActions` include `approve`, `deny`, `choose`, `retry`, `stop`, `open`, `open_context`, `copy`, `download`, and `custom`. Prefer stable `id` plus `action_id`/`actionId` values so the web UI can round-trip choices to Hermes.
- Telegram inline keyboards are adapter-specific; the web chat equivalent is a `uiActions` array. If a Hermes payload only contains a Telegram-style `reply_markup.inline_keyboard`, PiB will derive button actions as a fallback, but agents should emit web-native `uiActions` when possible.
- **Messages side canvas (mandatory):** every interactive turn injects `[Messages dynamic chat — Context Dock / side canvas]` with `conversationId` + `responseMessageId`. Canvas kinds: `email`, `invoice`, `quote`, `campaign`, `social`. On create, pass those ids so the platform auto-attaches `open_context`. Still echo returned `uiActions`/`contextRef`. Never fake a canvas with chat-only prose.
- Create paths: email → `POST /agent/email/drafts` or `/replies`; invoice → `POST /invoices`; quote → `POST /quotes`; campaign → `POST /campaigns`; social → `POST /social/posts`.
- Humans review in the Context Dock; do not auto-send, auto-publish, or auto-convert. Still link admin/portal workspaces for full edit flows.
- **Adding a new canvas kind (engineers):** extend `MESSAGES_CANVAS_KINDS` + registry in `lib/messages/openContextHandoff.ts` / `dynamicChatCanvasPrompt.ts`, add ContextDock preview, call `handoffOpenContextFromCreate` from the create route, update this skill. Wiki: `messages-open-context-hardening`.
- For approval, clarify, and model picker prompts, send a visible rich part and matching actions. The in-app UI renders those controls in `MessageBubble` and posts the chosen action through the admin agent run action route.

#### Context reference search

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/context-references/search` | client | Search attachable context references by `type`, `q`, `orgId`, optional `projectId`, `contextType`, `contextId`, and `limit`. |

Use this before adding references to conversations, comments, research items, or project artifacts. Context refs are tenant-scoped and access-filtered by the resolver; do not fabricate refs from raw IDs unless the resolver can see them.

### Reports (cross-cutting)

Moved to the `reports` skill — see `GET /reports/activity-summary` and `GET /reports/pipeline` there for the cross-cutting query reports, plus the full snapshot-report CRUD.

### Comments (full reference)

Listed in "Collaboration primitives" above. Full API:

#### `GET /comments?orgId=X&resourceType=...&resourceId=...` — auth: admin
Sorted `createdAt asc`. Default limit 100. `?includeDeleted=true` to include soft-deleted.

#### `POST /comments` — auth: admin
Creates + parses mentions + notifies mentioned users/agents (async). Response: `{ id, mentions }`.

#### `GET/PATCH/DELETE /comments/[id]` — auth: admin
PATCH: update `body` (re-parses mentions but **does not re-notify**), toggle `agentPickedUp`, update `attachments`.
DELETE soft by default; `?force=true` hard.

## Workflow guides

### 1. Set up a new AI agent

```bash
# Issue a scoped API key for the agent
POST /platform/api-keys
{ "name": "Sales follow-up agent", "role": "agent", "orgId": "org_abc",
  "expiresAt": "2027-01-01" }
# → { id, keyOnce: "pib_ag_...", keyPrefix: "pib_ag_abcd" }

# Discover available endpoints
GET /agent
```

### 2. Agent daily loop

```bash
# 1. Pull my inbox
GET /inbox?orgId=org_abc&for=me&unread=true

# 2. Process each item
#    - mention → GET the resource, read context, POST a reply comment
#    - assignment → do the task, then POST /tasks/[id]/complete
#    - overdue_invoice → GET /invoices/[id], POST follow-up email

# 3. Mark handled notifications read
POST /inbox/read
{ "itemIds": ["inbox_a", "inbox_b"] }
```

### 3. Subscribe to events

```bash
# Create webhook
POST /webhooks
{ "orgId": "org_abc", "name": "Slack", "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/...",
  "events": ["deal.won", "invoice.paid", "form.submitted"] }
# → { id: "wh_xyz", secretOnce: "abc...", secret: "***" }

# Test it
POST /webhooks/wh_xyz/test

# Check delivery history
GET /webhooks/wh_xyz/deliveries

# Replay a specific failed delivery
POST /webhooks/wh_xyz/deliveries/dl_abc/replay
```

### 4. Upload + attach a file to a comment

```bash
# 1. Upload
POST /upload   (multipart: file, orgId=org_abc, relatedToType=invoice, relatedToId=inv_xyz)
# → { id: "file_abc", url: "https://..." }

# 2. Attach to a comment
POST /comments
{ "orgId": "org_abc", "resourceType": "invoice", "resourceId": "inv_xyz",
  "body": "Updated quote attached.", "attachments": ["file_abc"] }
```

### 5. Find anything via search

```bash
GET /search?q=acme
# Returns top matching contacts, projects, tasks, invoices
```

### 6. Generate weekly activity summary

See the `reports` skill for the full request/response shape:

```bash
GET /reports/activity-summary?orgId=org_abc&from=2026-04-07&to=2026-04-13
```

### 7. Verify a webhook delivery

On the consumer side: parse headers, verify signature, check timestamp freshness. Sample Node code above.

On sender side: check deliveries for status:
```bash
GET /webhooks/wh_xyz/deliveries?limit=50
```

## Error reference

| HTTP | Error | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| 400 | `q must be at least 2 characters` | Lengthen search query |
| 400 | `Idempotency-Key required` (rare) | Pass the header |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Check `AI_API_KEY` or key expiry |
| 403 | Forbidden | Key lacks org access |
| 404 | `Webhook not found` | Verify id |
| 409 | Duplicate action | Check resource state |
| 429 | Rate limited | Respect `Retry-After` header |

## Agent patterns

1. **Poll `/inbox` as your work queue** — it's the unified view. For humans this is their dashboard; for agents it's the daily loop trigger.
2. **Comment before you act** — leave a comment stating what the agent is about to do, then execute, then update the comment with the result. Humans can trust and verify.
3. **Pass `Idempotency-Key` on creates** — especially in retry loops. A UUIDv4 per logical operation is ideal.
4. **Subscribe to webhooks instead of polling** — cheaper, faster, more reliable.
5. **Use `X-PIB-Timestamp` freshness check** — reject webhook payloads older than 5 minutes.
6. **Prefer soft-delete** — `DELETE` is soft by default; only use `?force=true` when you're certain.
7. **Search is eventually consistent** — freshly-created items may not appear for ~1 min.
8. **Activity log everything** — use `POST /activity` (auto-written by most routes) for a durable audit trail.
