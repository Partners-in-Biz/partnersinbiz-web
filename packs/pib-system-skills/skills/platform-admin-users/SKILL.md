# Platform Admin Users — Partners in Biz Platform API

Manages PiB **internal staff** (users with `role === 'admin'`). Restricted to **super admins
only** — an admin whose `allowedOrgIds` array is empty. A restricted admin (non-empty
`allowedOrgIds`) cannot call these endpoints; this prevents silent self-elevation.

## Related skills

- `agent-runtime-ops` — Hermes agent registry/admin (different from platform staff users)
- `platform-ops` — general platform primitives
- `system-auth` — auth/delegation mint & resolve rules

## Auth (mandatory)

Interactive Hermes runs use the **user-delegation** token injected by Messages / minted via `system-auth` (`Authorization: Bearer pib_dlg_…` + `X-Org-Id`).

- Prefer the injected delegation token for all `/api/v1/*` calls in a human-triggered run.
- `AI_API_KEY` / agent system keys are **cron/system only**.
- Never claim a write succeeded without read-back (see pack `verificationContract` / skill success gate).
- See skill `system-auth` for mint/resolve rules.

## Base URL & Authentication

```
https://partnersinbiz.online/api/v1
```

```
Authorization: Bearer <AI_API_KEY>
```

All routes below additionally require the caller to be a **super admin** (`allowedOrgIds: []`).

## User model

```json
{
  "uid": "firebase_uid",
  "email": "staff@partnersinbiz.online",
  "displayName": "Alice Smith",
  "role": "admin",
  "orgId": "PIB_PLATFORM_ORG_ID",
  "allowedOrgIds": ["org_abc", "org_xyz"],
  "isSuperAdmin": false,
  "createdAt": "...",
  "updatedAt": "..."
}
```

`isSuperAdmin` is a derived field: `true` when `allowedOrgIds.length === 0`. It is never stored; it is computed on every read.

## `allowedOrgIds` scoping concept

- **Super admin** — `allowedOrgIds: []` (empty). Sees and manages every org on the platform.
- **Restricted admin** — `allowedOrgIds: ["org_a", "org_b"]`. UI and API scope them to those orgs only.
- To convert a restricted admin to super admin, PATCH with `allowedOrgIds: []`.
- A super admin **cannot restrict their own account** via PATCH — they must ask a different super admin. This prevents accidental self-lockout.
- `allowedOrgIds` is admin-surface visibility only. It does not grant client portal/CRM access. To let a PiB admin enter a client portal, add the staff user as an explicit member of that client org through `/admin/org/[slug]/team` or `POST /organizations/[id]/members`.
- For `/admin/org/partners-in-biz/billing`, restricted admins see only PiB-issued invoices where the recipient client is inside `allowedOrgIds`; super admins see all PiB-issued invoices.

## API Reference

### `GET /admin/platform-users` — auth: super-admin

Lists all users with `role === 'admin'`, sorted newest first.

Response:
```json
[
  { "uid": "...", "email": "...", "displayName": "...", "role": "admin",
    "orgId": "...", "allowedOrgIds": ["org_abc"], "isSuperAdmin": false,
    "createdAt": "...", "updatedAt": "..." }
]
```

### `POST /admin/platform-users` — auth: super-admin

Creates a new platform staff account. Finds or creates the Firebase Auth user, writes the `users` doc, then optionally sends a welcome email with a password-setup link.

Body:
```json
{
  "email": "newstaff@example.com",
  "name": "Bob Jones",
  "allowedOrgIds": ["org_abc"],
  "sendWelcomeEmail": true
}
```

- `allowedOrgIds` — omit or pass `[]` for a super admin; pass org IDs to restrict.
- `sendWelcomeEmail` — defaults to `true`. Sends a branded email from the platform address with a Firebase password-reset link so the new user can set their own password.
- If a user with this email already exists as a **non-admin** role (e.g. `member`), returns `409` — resolve in the team page first.

Response (201):
```json
{
  "uid": "...", "email": "...", "displayName": "...", "role": "admin",
  "orgId": "PIB_PLATFORM_ORG_ID", "allowedOrgIds": [],
  "isSuperAdmin": true,
  "setupLink": "https://..."
}
```

`setupLink` is the Firebase password-reset URL returned once at creation. Store or send it immediately — it is not re-exposed later.

### `GET /admin/platform-users/[uid]` — auth: super-admin

Returns a single platform admin by UID. Returns `404` if the UID exists but is not an admin.

### `PATCH /admin/platform-users/[uid]` — auth: super-admin

Updatable fields:
- `name` — updates both Firestore `displayName` and Firebase Auth display name. Cannot be empty string.
- `allowedOrgIds` — replaces the full list. Pass `[]` to promote to super admin. Deduplication and trimming applied automatically.

Self-restriction guardrail: if `uid === caller.uid` and `allowedOrgIds` is non-empty, returns `400` — ask another super admin to do it.

Response: updated user object.

### `DELETE /admin/platform-users/[uid]` — auth: super-admin

Deletes the Firebase Auth user (revokes all sessions) and removes the Firestore `users` doc. Cannot delete yourself — returns `400`.

Response: `{ "uid": "...", "deleted": true }`.

### Password / reset utility routes

| Method | Path | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| PATCH | `/admin/platform-members/[uid]/password` | super-admin | Set/reset platform member password. |
| POST | `/admin/platform-members/[uid]/reset` | super-admin | Send/reset platform member access. |
| PATCH | `/admin/platform-users/[uid]/password` | super-admin | Set/reset platform user password. |
| POST | `/admin/platform-users/[uid]/reset` | super-admin | Send/reset platform user access. |

`platform-members` and `platform-users` are the same underlying staff-account concept exposed through two route families — use whichever the calling surface (admin UI page) already targets; both require super-admin.

## Workflow: onboard a new staff member

```bash
# 1. Create the account (welcome email sent automatically)
POST /admin/platform-users
{ "email": "alice@example.com", "name": "Alice Smith",
  "allowedOrgIds": ["org_client1", "org_client2"] }
# → { uid, setupLink }

# 2. If the email failed or they need a new link, use Firebase Console
#    or re-POST with sendWelcomeEmail: true (idempotent — merges the doc)

# 3. Promote to super admin later
PATCH /admin/platform-users/<uid>
{ "allowedOrgIds": [] }

# 4. Off-board
DELETE /admin/platform-users/<uid>
```

## Error reference

| HTTP | Error | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| 400 | `name cannot be empty` | Provide a non-empty `name` on PATCH |
| 400 | Self-restriction blocked | Ask a different super admin to restrict this account |
| 400 | Self-delete blocked | Cannot delete your own account |
| 403 | Forbidden | Caller is a restricted admin, not a super admin |
| 409 | Email already exists as non-admin role | Resolve via the team page first |
| 404 | Not an admin | UID exists but `role !== 'admin'` |

## Agent patterns

1. **Verify super-admin status before attempting any write** — a 403 here means the caller lacks authority, not that the resource is missing.
2. **Always read back after create/patch/delete** to confirm the staff record matches what was requested.
3. **Never invent `allowedOrgIds` values** — resolve real org IDs first (see `client-manager`).
4. **Treat `setupLink` as one-time-sensitive** — store/send immediately, do not log it long-term.
5. **Distinguish this from `agent-runtime-ops`** — platform users are human staff logins; agents/Hermes profiles are a separate registry.
